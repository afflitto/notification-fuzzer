INTRODUCTION I can admit it freely now
All my life I've been a patsy
For as long as I can recall
I've been an easy mark for the pitches of peddlers, fund raisers, and operators of one sort or another
True, only some of these people have had dishonorable motives
The others — representatives of certain charitable agencies, for instance — have had the best of intentions
No matter
With personally disquieting frequency, I have always found myself in possession of unwanted magazine subscriptions or tickets to the sanitation workers' ball
Probably this longstanding status as sucker accounts for my interest in the study of compliance: Just what are the factors that cause one person to say yes to another person? And which techniques most effectively use these factors to bring about such compliance? I wondered why it is that a request stated in a certain way will be rejected, while a request that asks for the same favor in a slightly different fashion will be successful
So in my role as an experimental social psychologist, I began to do research into the psychology of compliance
At first the research took the form of experiments performed, for the most part, in my laboratory and on college students
I wanted to find out which psycho logical principles   the tendency to comply with a request
Right now, psychologists know quite a bit about these principles — what they are and how they work
I have characterized such principles as weapons of   and will report on some of the most important in the up coming chapters
After a time, though, I began to realize that the experimental work, while necessary, wasn't enough
It didn't allow me to judge the import ance of the principles in the world beyond the psychology building and the campus where I was examining them
It became clear that if I was to understand fully the psychology of compliance, I would need to broaden my scope of investigation
I would need to look to the compli ance professionals — the people who had been using the principles on me all my life
They know what works and what doesn't; the law of survival of the fittest assures it
Their business is to make us comply, and their livelihoods depend on it
Those who don't know how to get people to say yes soon fall away; those who do, stay and flourish
Of course, the compliance professionals aren't the only ones who know about and use these principles to help them get their way
We all employ them and fall victim to them, to some degree, in our daily interactions with neighbors, friends, lovers, and offspring
But the compliance practitioners have much more than the vague and amateur ish understanding of what works than the rest of us have
As I thought about it, I knew that they represented the richest vein of information about compliance available to me
For nearly three years, then, I com bined my experimental studies with a decidedly more entertaining program of systematic immersion into the world of compliance profes sionals — sales operators, fundraisers, recruiters, advertisers, and others
The purpose was to observe, from the inside, the techniques and strategies most commonly and effectively used by a broad range of compliance practitioners
That program of observation sometimes took the form of interviews with the practitioners themselves and sometimes with the natural enemies (for example, police buncosquad officers, consumer agencies) of certain of the practitioners
At other times it in volved an intensive examination of the written materials by which compliance techniques are passed down from one generation to anoth er — sales manuals and the like
Most frequently, though, it has taken the form of participant observa tion
Participant observation is a research approach in which the re searcher becomes a spy of sorts
With disguised identity and intent, the investigator infiltrates the setting of interest and becomes a fullfledged participant in the group to be studied
So when I wanted to learn about the compliance tactics of encyclopedia (or vacuumcleaner, or portrait photography, or dancelesson) sales organizations, I would answer a newspaper ad for sales trainees and have them teach me their methods
Using similar but not identical approaches, I was able to penetrate ad vertising, publicrelations, and fundraising agencies to examine their techniques
Much of the evidence presented in this book, then, comes from my experience posing as a compliance professional, or aspiring professional, in a large variety of organizations dedicated to getting us to say yes
One aspect of what I learned in this threeyear period of participant observation was most instructive
Although there are thousands of different tactics that compliance practitioners employ to produce yes, the majority fall within six basic categories
Each of these categories is governed by a fundamental psychological principle that directs human behavior and, in so doing, gives the tactics their power
The book is organized around these six principles, one to a chapter
The prin ciples — consistency, reciprocation, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity — are each discussed in terms of their function in the society and in terms of how their enormous force can be commissioned by a compliance professional who deftly incorporates them into requests for purchases, donations, concessions, votes, assent, etc
It is worthy of note that I have not included among the six principles the simple rule of material selfinterest — that people want to get the most and pay the least for their choices
This omission does not stem from any perception on my part that the desire to maximize benefits and minimize costs is unimportant in driving our decisions
Nor does it come from any evidence I have that compliance professionals ignore the power of this rule
Quite the opposite: In my investigations, I frequently saw practi tioners use (sometimes honestly, sometimes not) the compelling "I can give you a good deal" approach
I choose not to treat the material self interest rule separately in this book because I see it as a motivational given, as a goeswithoutsaying factor that deserves acknowledgment but not extensive description
Finally, each principle is examined as to its ability to produce a distinct kind of automatic, mindless compliance from people, that is, a willing ness to say yes without thinking first
The evidence suggests that the everaccelerating pace and informational crush of modern life will make this particular form of unthinking compliance more and more prevalent in the future
It will be increasingly important for the society, therefore, to understand the how and why of automatic  
It has been some time since the first edition of   was published
In the interim, some things have happened that I feel deserve a place in this new edition
First, we now know more about the   process than before
The study of persuasion, compliance, and change has advanced, and the pages that follow have been adapted to reflect that progress
In addition to an overall update of the material, I have included a new feature that was stimulated by the responses of prior readers
That new feature highlights the experiences of individuals who have read  , recognized how one of the principles worked on (or for) them in a particular instance, and wrote to me describing the event
Their descriptions, which appear in the Reader's Reports at the end of each chapter, illustrate how easily and frequently we can fall victim to the pull of the   process in our everyday lives
I wish to thank the following individuals who — either directly or through their course instructors — contributed the Reader's Reports used in this edition: Pat Bobbs, Mark Hastings, James Michaels, Paul R
Nail, Alan J
Resnik, Daryl Retzlaff, Dan Swift, and Karla Vasks
In addition, I would like to invite new readers to submit similar reports for possible publication in a future edition

Chapter 1 WEAPONS OF INFLUENCE  Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not sim pler
— Albert Einstein T GOT A PHONE CALL ONE DAY FROM A FRIEND WHO HAD RECENTLY opened an Indian jewelry store in Arizona
She was giddy with a curious piece of news
Something fascinating had just happened, and she thought that, as a psychologist, I might be able to explain it to her
The story involved a certain allotment of turquoise jewelry she had been having trouble selling
It was the peak of the tourist season, the store was unusually full of customers, the turquoise pieces were of good quality for the prices she was asking; yet they had not sold
My friend had attempted a couple of standard sales tricks to get them moving
She tried calling attention to them by shifting their location to a more central display area; no luck
She even told her sales staff to "push" the items hard, again without success
Finally, the night before leaving on an outoftown buying trip, she scribbled an exasperated note to her head saleswoman, "Everything in this display case, price x Vi," hoping just to be rid of the offending pieces, even if at a loss
When she returned a few days later, she was not sur prised to find that every article had been sold
She was shocked, though, to discover that, because the employee had read the “V 2 " in her scrawled message as a "2," the entire allotment had sold out at twice the original price!  That's when she called me
I thought I knew what had happened but told her that, if I were to explain things properly, she would have to listen to a story of mine
Actually, it isn't my story; it's about mother turkeys, and it belongs to the relatively new science of ethology — the study of animals in their natural settings
Turkey mothers are good mothers — loving, watchful, and protective
They spend much of their time tending, warming, cleaning, and huddling the young beneath them
But there is something odd about their method
Virtually all of this mothering is triggered by one thing: the "cheepcheep" sound of young turkey chicks
Other identifying features of the chicks, such as their smell, touch, or appearance, seem to play minor roles in the mothering process
If a chick makes the "cheepcheep" noise, its mother will care for it; if not, the mother will ignore or sometimes kill it
The extreme reliance of maternal turkeys upon this one sound was dramatically illustrated by animal behaviorist M
W
Fox in his descrip tion of an experiment involving a mother turkey and a stuffed polecat
1 For a mother turkey, a polecat is a natural enemy whose approach is to be greeted with squawking, pecking, clawing rage
Indeed, the exper imenters found that even a stuffed model of a polecat, when drawn by a string toward a mother turkey, received an immediate and furious attack
When, however, the same stuffed replica carried inside it a small recorder that played the "cheepcheep" sound of baby turkeys, the mother not only accepted the oncoming polecat but gathered it under neath her
When the machine was turned off, the polecat model again drew a vicious attack
How ridiculous a female turkey seems under these circumstances: She will embrace a natural enemy just because it goes "cheepcheep," and she will mistreat or murder one of her own chicks just because it does not
She looks like an automaton whose maternal instincts are under the automatic control of that single sound
The ethologists tell us that this sort of thing is far from unique to the turkey
They have begun to identify regular, blindly mechanical patterns of action in a wide variety of species
Called fixedaction patterns, they can involve intricate sequences of behavior, such as entire courtship or mating rituals
A fundamental characteristic of these patterns is that the behaviors that compose them occur in virtually the same fashion and in the same order every time
It is almost as if the patterns were recorded on tapes within the animals
When the situation calls for courtship, the courtship tape gets played; when the situation calls for mothering, the maternalbehavior tape gets played
Click and the appropriate tape is activated; whirr and out rolls the standard sequence of behaviors
The most interesting thing about all this is the way the tapes are ac tivated
When a male animal acts to defend his territory, for instance, it is the intrusion of another male of the same species that cues the ter ritorialdefense tape of rigid vigilance, threat, and, if need be, combat behaviors
But there is a quirk in the system
It is not the rival male as a whole that is the trigger; it is some specific feature of him, the trigger feature
Often the trigger feature will be just one tiny aspect of the totality that is the approaching intruder
Sometimes a shade of color is the trigger feature
The experiments of ethologists have shown, for instance, that a male robin, acting as if a rival robin had entered its territory, will vigorously attack nothing more than a clump of robinredbreast feathers placed there
At the same time, it will virtually ignore a perfect stuffed replica of a male robin without red breast feathers; similar results have been found in another species of bird, the bluethroat, where it appears that the trigger for territorial defense is a specific shade of blue breast feathers/ Before we enjoy too smugly the ease with which lower animals can be tricked by trigger features into reacting in ways wholly inappropriate to the situation, we might realize two things
First, the automatic, fixed action patterns of these animals work very well the great majority of the time
For example, because only healthy, normal turkey chicks make the peculiar sound of baby turkeys, it makes sense for mother turkeys to respond maternally to that single "cheepcheep" noise
By reacting to just that one stimulus, the average mother turkey will nearly always behave correctly
It takes a trickster like a scientist to make her tapelike response seem silly
The second important thing to understand is that we, too, have our preprogrammed tapes; and, although they usually work to our advantage, the trigger features that activate them can be used to dupe us into playing them at the wrong times
3 This parallel form of human automatic action is aptly demonstrated in an experiment by Harvard social psychologist Ellen Langer
A well known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason
People simply like to have reasons for what they do
Langer demon strated this unsurprising fact by asking a small favor of people waiting in line to use a library copying machine: Excuse me, I have five pages
May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush? The effectiveness of this requestplusreason was nearly total: Ninetyfour percent of those asked let her skip ahead of them in line
Compare this success rate to the results when she made the request only: Excuse me, I have five pages
May I use 4 /   the Xerox machine? Under those circumstances, only 60 percent of those asked complied
At first glance, it appears that the crucial difference between the two requests was the additional information provided by the words "because I'm in a rush." But a third type of request tried by Langer showed that this was not the case
It seems that it was not the whole series of words, but the first one, "because," that made the differ ence
Instead of including a real reason for compliance, Langer's third type of request used the word "because" and then, adding nothing new, merely restated the obvious: Excuse me, I have five pages
May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies ? The result was that once again nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real reason, no new information, was added to justify their compliance
Just as the "cheepcheep" sound of turkey chicks triggered an automatic mothering response from maternal turkeys — even when it emanated from a stuffed polecat — so, too, did the word "because" trigger an automatic compli ance response from Langer's subjects, even when they were given no subsequent reason to comply
Click, whirr / 4 Although some of Langer's additional findings show that there are many situations in which human behavior does not work in a mechan ical, tapeactivated way, what is astonishing is how often it does
For instance, consider the strange behavior of those jewelrystore customers who swooped down on an allotment of turquoise pieces only after the items had been mistakenly offered at double their original price
I can make no sense of their behavior, unless it is viewed in click, whirr terms
The customers, mostly welltodo vacationers with little knowledge of turquoise, were using a standard principle — a stereotype — to guide their buying: "expensive = good." Thus the vacationers, who wanted "good" jewelry, saw the turquoise pieces as decidedly more valuable and desirable when nothing about them was enhanced but the price
Price alone had become a trigger feature for quality; and a dramatic increase in price alone had led to a dramatic increase in sales among the qualityhungry buyers
Click, whirr! It is easy to fault the tourists for their foolish purchase decisions
But a close look offers a kinder view
These were people who had been brought up on the rule "You get what you pay for" and who had seen that rule borne out over and over in their lives
Before long, they had translated the rule to mean "expensive = good." The "expensive = good" stereotype had worked quite well for them in the past, since normally the price of an item increases along with its worth; a higher price typic ally reflects higher quality
So when they found themselves in the pos ition of wanting good turquoise jewelry without much knowledge of   5 turquoise, they understandably relied on the old standby feature of cost to determine the jewelry's merits
Although they probably did not realize it, by reacting solely to the price feature of the turquoise, they were playing a shortcut version of betting the odds
Instead of stacking all the odds in their favor by trying painstakingly to master each of the things that indicate the worth of turquoise jewelry, they were counting on just one — the one they knew to be usually associated with the quality of any item
They were betting that price alone would tell them all they needed to know
This time, because someone mistook a “W for a "2," they bet wrong
But in the long run, over all the past and future situations of their lives, betting those shortcut odds may represent the most rational approach possible
In fact, automatic, stereotyped behavior is prevalent in much of hu man action, because in many cases it is the most efficient form of behav ing, and in other cases it is simply necessary
You and I exist in an ex traordinarily complicated stimulus environment, easily the most rapidly moving and complex that has ever existed on this planet
To deal with it, we need shortcuts
We can't be expected to recognize and analyze all the aspects in each person, event, and situation we encounter in even one day
We haven't the time, energy, or capacity for it
Instead, we must very often use our stereotypes, our rules of thumb to classify things according to a few key features and then to respond mindlessly when one or another of these trigger features is present
Sometimes the behavior that unrolls will not be appropriate for the situation, because not even the best stereotypes and trigger features work every time
But we accept their imperfection, since there is really no other choice
Without them we would stand frozen — cataloging, appraising, and calibrating — as the time for action sped by and away
And from all indications, we will be relying on them to an even greater extent in the future
As the stimuli saturating our lives continue to grow more intricate and variable, we will have to depend increasingly on our shortcuts to handle them all
The renowned British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead recog nized this inescapable quality of modern life when he asserted that "civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them." Take, for example, the "ad vance" offered to civilization by the discount coupon, which allows consumers to assume that they will receive a reduced purchase price by presenting the coupon
The extent to which we have learned to op erate mechanically on that assumption is illustrated in the experience of one automobile tire company
Mailedout coupons that — because of a printing error — offered no savings to recipients produced just as much customer response as did errorfree coupons that offered substantial 6 /   savings
The obvious but instructive point here is that we expect dis count coupons to do double duty
Not only do we expect them to save us money, we also expect them to save us the time and mental energy required to think about how to do it
In today's world, we need the first advantage to handle pocketbook strain; but we need the second advant age to handle something potentially more important — brain strain
It is odd that despite their current widespread use and looming future importance, most of us know very little about our automatic behavior patterns
Perhaps that is so precisely because of the mechanistic, un thinking manner in which they occur
Whatever the reason, it is vital that we clearly recognize one of their properties: They make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who does know how they work
To understand fully the nature of our vulnerability, another glance at the work of the ethologists is in order
It turns out that these animal behaviorists with their recorded "cheepcheeps" and their clumps of colored breast feathers are not the only ones who have discovered how to activate the behavior tapes of various species
There is a group of organisms, often termed mimics, that copy the trigger features of other animals in an attempt to trick these animals into mistakenly playing the right behavior tapes at the wrong times
The mimic will then exploit this altogether inappropriate action for its own benefit
Take, for example, the deadly trick played by the killer females of one genus of firefly (Photuris) on the males of another firefly genus (Photinus)
Understandably, the Photinus males scrupulously avoid contact with the bloodthirsty Photuris females
But through centuries of experience, the female hunters have located a weakness in their prey — a special blinking courtship code by which members of the vic tims' species tell one another they are ready to mate
Somehow, the Photuris female has cracked the Photinus courtship code
By mimicking the flashing mating signals of her prey, the murderess is able to feast on the bodies of males whose triggered courtship tapes cause them to fly mechanically into death's, not love's, embrace
Insects seem to be the most severe exploiters of the automaticity of their prey; it is not uncommon to find their victims duped to death
But less uncompromising forms of exploitation occur as well
There is, for instance, a little fish, the sabertoothed blenny, that takes advantage of an unusual program of cooperation worked out by members of two other species of fish
The cooperating fish form a Mutt and Jeff team consisting of a large grouper fish on the one hand and a much smaller type of fish on the other
The smaller fish serves as a cleaner to the larger one, which allows the cleaner to approach it and even enter its mouth to pick off fungus and other parasites that have attached themselves to   7 the big fish's teeth or gills
It is a beautiful arrangement: The big grouper gets cleaned of harmful pests, and the cleaner fish gets an easy dinner
The larger fish normally devours any other small fish foolish enough to come close to it
But when the cleaner approaches, the big fish sud denly stops all movement and floats openmouthed and nearly immobile in response to an undulating dance that the cleaner performs
This dance appears to be the trigger feature of the cleaner that activates the dramatic passivity of the big fish
It also provides the sabertoothed blenny with an angle — a chance to take advantage of the cleaning ritual of the cooperators
The blenny will approach the large predator, copying the undulations of the cleaner's dance and automatically producing the tranquil, unmoving posture of the big fish
Then, true to its name, it will quickly rip a mouthful from the larger fish's flesh and dart away before its startled victim can recover
5 There is a strong but sad parallel in the human jungle
We too have exploiters who mimic trigger features for our own brand of automatic responding
Unlike the mostly instinctive response sequences of non humans, our automatic tapes usually develop from psychological principles or stereotypes we have learned to accept
Although they vary in their force, some of these principles possess a tremendous ability to direct human action
We have been subjected to them from such an early point in our lives, and they have moved us about so pervasively since then, that you and I rarely perceive their power
In the eyes of others, though, each such principle is a detectable and ready weapon — a weapon of automatic  
There is a group of people who know very well where the weapons of automatic   lie and who employ them regularly and expertly to get what they want
They go from social encounter to social encounter requesting others to comply with their wishes; their frequency of success is dazzling
The secret of their effectiveness lies in the way they structure their requests, the way they arm themselves with one or another of the weapons of   that exist within the social environment
To do this may take no more than one correctly chosen word that engages a strong psychological principle and sets an automatic behavior tape rolling within us
And trust the human exploiters to learn quickly exactly how to profit from our tendency to respond mechanically according to these principles
Remember my friend the jewelrystore owner? Although she benefited by accident the first time, it did not take her long to begin exploiting the "expensive = good" stereotype regularly and intentionally
Now, during the tourist season, she first tries to speed the sale of an item that has been difficult to move by increasing its price substantially
She claims that this is marvelously costeffective
When it works on the 8 /   unsuspecting vacationers — as it frequently does — it results in an enormous profit margin
And even when it is not initially successful, she can mark the article "Reduced from " and sell it at its original price while still taking advantage of the "expensive = good" reaction to the inflated figure
By no means is my friend original in this last use of the "expensive = good" rule to snare those seeking a bargain
Culturist and author Leo Rosten gives the example of the Drubeck brothers, Sid and Harry, who owned a men's tailor shop in Rosten's neighborhood while he was growing up in the 1930s
Whenever the salesman, Sid, had a new cus tomer trying on suits in front of the shop's threesided mirror, he would admit to a hearing problem, and, as they talked, he would repeatedly request that the man speak more loudly to him
Once the customer had found a suit he liked and had asked for the price, Sid would call to his brother, the head tailor, at the back of the room, "Harry, how much for this suit?" Looking up from his work — and greatly exaggerating the suit's true price — Harry would call back, "For that beautiful allwool suit, fortytwo dollars." Pretending not to have heard and cupping his hand to his ear, Sid would ask again
Once more Harry would reply, "Fortytwo dollars." At this point, Sid would turn to the customer and report, "He says twentytwo dollars." Many a man would hurry to buy the suit and scramble out of the shop with his "expensive = good" bargain before Poor Sid discovered the "mistake." There are several components shared by most of the weapons of automatic   to be described in this book
We have already dis cussed two of them — the nearly mechanical process by which the power within these weapons can be activated, and the consequent exploitability of this power by anyone who knows how to trigger them
A third component involves the way that the weapons of automatic   lend their force to those who use them
It's not that the weapons, like a set of heavy clubs, provide a conspicuous arsenal to be used by one person to bludgeon another into submission
The process is much more sophisticated and subtle
With proper ex ecution, the exploiters need hardly strain a muscle to get their way
All that is required is to trigger the great stores of   that already exist in the situation and direct them toward the intended target
In this sense, the approach is not unlike that of the Japanese martialart form called jujitsu
A woman employing jujitsu would utilize her own strength only minimally against an opponent
Instead, she would exploit the power inherent in such naturally present principles as gravity, leverage, momentum, and inertia
If she knows how and where to en gage the action of these principles, she can easily defeat a physically   9 stronger rival
And so it is for the exploiters of the weapons of automatic   that exist naturally around us
The exploiters can commission the power of these weapons for use against their targets while exerting little personal force
This last feature of the process allows the exploiters an enormous additional benefit — the ability to manipulate without the appearance of manipulation
Even the victims themselves tend to see their compliance as determined by the action of natural forces rather than by the designs of the person who profits from that compliance
An example is in order
There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another
Simply put, if the second item is fairly different from the first, we will tend to see it as more dif ferent than it actually is
So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we will estimate the second object to be heavier than if we had lifted it without first trying the light one
The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions besides weight
If we are talking to a beautiful woman at a cocktail party and are then joined by an unattractive one, the second woman will strike us as less attractive than she actually is
In fact, studies done on the contrast principle at Arizona State and Montana State universities suggest that we may be less satisfied with the physical attractiveness of our own lovers because of the way the popular media bombard us with examples of unrealistically attractive models
In one study college students rated a picture of an average looking member of the opposite sex as less attractive if they had first looked through the ads in some popular magazines
In another study, male collegedormitory residents rated the photo of a potential blind date
Those who did so while watching an episode of the Charlie's Angels TV series viewed the blind date as a less attractive woman than those who rated her while watching a different show
Apparently it was the uncommon beauty of the Angels female stars that made the blind date seem less attractive
6 A nice demonstration of perceptual contrast is sometimes employed in psychophysics laboratories to introduce students to the principle firsthand
Each student takes a turn sitting in front of three pails of water — one cold, one at room temperature, and one hot
After placing one hand in the cold water and one in the hot water, the student is told to place both in the lukewarm water simultaneously
The look of amused bewilderment that immediately registers tells the story: Even though both hands are in the same bucket, the hand that has been in the cold water feels as if it is now in hot water, while the one that was in the hot water feels as if it is now in cold water
The point is that the same 10 /   thing — in this instance, room temperature water — can be made to seem very different, depending on the nature of the event that precedes it
Be assured that the nice little weapon of   provided by the contrast principle does not go unexploited
The great advantage of this principle is not only that it works but also that it is virtually undetect able
Those who employ it can cash in on its   without any ap pearance of having structured the situation in their favor
Retail clothiers are a good example
Suppose a man enters a fashionable men's store and says that he wants to buy a threepiece suit and a sweater
If you were the salesperson, which would you show him first to make him likely to spend the most money? Clothing stores instruct their sales personnel to sell the costly item first
Common sense might suggest the reverse: If a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend very much more on the purchase of a sweater
But the clothiers know better
They behave in accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison
A man might balk at the idea of spending $95 for a sweater, but if he has just bought a $495 suit, a $95 sweater does not seem excessive
The same principle applies to a man who wishes to buy the accessories (shirt, shoes, belt) to go along with his new suit
Contrary to the commonsense view, the evidence supports the contrastprinciple prediction
As sales motivation analysts Whitney, Hubin, and Murphy state, "The interesting thing is that even when a man enters a clothing store with the express purpose of purchasing a suit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys if he buys them after the suit purchase than before." It is much more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first, not only because to fail to do so will lose the   of the contrast principle; to fail to do so will also cause the principle to work actively against them
Presenting an inexpensive product first and fol lowing it with an expensive one will cause the expensive item to seem even more costly as a result — hardly a desirable consequence for most sales organizations
So, just as it is possible to make the same bucket of water appear to be hotter or colder, depending on the temperature of previously presented water, it is possible to make the price of the same item seem higher or lower, depending on the price of a previously presented item
Clever use of perceptual contrast is by no means confined to clothiers
I came across a technique that engaged the contrast principle while I was investigating, undercover, the compliance tactics of realestate companies
To "learn the ropes," I was accompanying a company realty salesman on a weekend of showing houses to prospective home buyers
 II The salesman — we can call him Phil — was to give me tips to help me through my breakin period
One thing I quickly noticed was that whenever Phil began showing a new set of customers potential buys, he would start with a couple of undesirable houses
I asked him about it, and he laughed
They were what he called "setup" properties
The company maintained a rundown house or two on its lists at inflated prices
These houses were not intended to be sold to customers but to be shown to them, so that the genuine properties in the company's in ventory would benefit from the comparison
Not all the sales staff made use of the setup houses, but Phil did
He said he liked to watch his prospects' "eyes light up" when he showed the place he really wanted to sell them after they had seen the rundown houses
"The house I got them spotted for looks really great after they've first looked at a couple of dumps." Automobile dealers use the contrast principle by waiting until the price for a new car has been negotiated before suggesting one option after another that might be added
In the wake of a fifteenthousand dollar deal, the hundred or so dollars required for a nicety like an FM radio seems almost trivial in comparison
The same will be true of the added expense of accessories like tinted windows, dual sideview mir rors, whitewall tires, or special trim that the salesman might suggest in sequence
The trick is to bring up the extras independently of one another, so that each small price will seem petty when compared to the alreadydetermined much larger one
As the veteran car buyer can attest, many a budgetsized final price figure has ballooned from the addition of all those seemingly little options
While the customer stands, signed contract in hand, wondering what happened and finding no one to blame but himself, the car dealer stands smiling the knowing smile of the jujitsu master
READER'S REPORT From the Parent of a College Coed Dear Mother and Dad: Since I left for college I have been remiss in writing and I am sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written be fore
I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down
You are not to read any further unless you are sitting down, okay? Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now
The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out the window of my dormitory when it caught on fire shortly after my arrival here is pretty well healed now
I only spent two 12 /   weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick headaches once a day
Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory, and my jump, was witnessed by an at tendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Department and the ambulance
He also visited me in the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burntout dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him
It's really a base ment room, but it's kind of cute
He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married
We haven't got the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show
Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant

Chapter 2 RECIPROCATION The Old Give and Take..
and Take Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill
— RALPH WALDO EMERSON A FEW YEARS AGO, A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR TRIED A LITTLE experi merit
He sent Christmas cards to a sample of perfect strangers
Although he expected some reaction, the response he received was amazing — holiday cards addressed to him came pouring back from the people who had never met nor heard of him
The great majority of those who returned a card never inquired into the identity of the unknown professor
They received his holiday greeting card, click, and, whirr, they automatically sent one in return
While small in scope, this study nicely shows the action of one of the most potent of the weapons of in fluence around us — the rule for reciprocation 
1 The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us
If a woman does us a favor, we should do her one in return; if a man sends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a gift of our own; if a couple invites us to a party, we should be sure to invite them to one of ours
By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then, we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like
So typical is it for indebtedness to accompany the receipt of such things that a term like "much obliged" has become a synonym for "thank you," not only in the English language but in others as well
The impressive aspect of the rule for reciprocation and the sense of obligation that goes with it is its pervasiveness in human culture
It is so widespread that after intensive study, sociologists such as Alvin 14 /   Gouldner can report that there is no human society that does not sub scribe to the rule
2 And within each society it seems pervasive also; it permeates exchanges of every kind
Indeed, it may well be that a de veloped system of indebtedness flowing from the rule for reciprocation is a unique property of human culture
The noted archaeologist Richard Leakey ascribes the essence of what makes us human to the reciprocity system: "We are human because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation," 3 he says
Cultural anthropologists Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox view this "web of indebtedness" as a unique adaptive mechanism of human beings, al lowing for the division of labor, the exchange of diverse forms of goods, the exchange of different services (making it possible for experts to develop), and the creation of a cluster of interdependencies that bind individuals together into highly efficient units
It is the future orientation inherent in a sense of obligation that is critical to its ability to produce social advances of the sort described by Tiger and Fox
A widely shared and strongly held feeling of future ob ligation made an enormous difference in human social evolution, be cause it meant that one person could give something (for example, food, energy, care) to another with confidence that it was not being lost
For the first time in evolutionary history, one individual could give away any of a variety of resources without actually giving them away
The result was the lowering of the natural inhibitions against transactions that must be begun by one person's providing personal resources to another
Sophisticated and coordinated systems of aid, gift giving, de fense, and trade became possible, bringing immense benefit to the soci eties that possessed them
With such clearly adaptive consequences for the culture, it is not surprising that the rule for reciprocation is so deeply implanted in us by the process of socialization we all undergo
I know of no better illustration of how reciprocal obligations can reach long and powerfully into the future than the perplexing story of five thousand dollars of relief aid that was sent in 1985 between Mexico and the impoverished people of Ethiopia
In 1985 Ethiopia could justly lay claim to the greatest suffering and privation in the world
Its eco nomy was in ruin
Its food supply had been ravaged by years of drought and internal war
Its inhabitants were dying by the thousands from disease and starvation
Under these circumstances, I would not have been surprised to learn of a fivethousanddollar relief donation from Mexico to that wrenchingly needy country
I remember my chin hitting my chest, though, when a brief newspaper item I was reading insisted that the aid had gone in the opposite direction
Native officials of the Ethiopian Red Cross had decided to send the money to help the victims of that year's earthquakes in Mexico City
  15 It is both a personal bane and a professional blessing that whenever I am confused by some aspect of human behavior, I feel driven to in vestigate further
In this instance, I was able to track down a fuller ac count of the story
Fortunately a journalist who had been as bewildered as I was by the Ethiopians' action had asked for an explanation
The answer he received offers eloquent validation of the reciprocity rule: Despite the enormous needs prevailing in Ethiopia, the money was being sent because Mexico had sent aid to Ethiopia in 1935, when it was invaded by Italy
So informed, I remained awed, but I was no longer puzzled
The need to reciprocate had transcended great cultural differ ences, long distances, acute famine, and immediate selfinterest
Quite simply, a half century later, against all countervailing forces, obligation triumphed
Make no mistake, human societies derive a truly significant compet itive advantage from the reciprocity rule, and consequently they make sure their members are trained to comply with and believe in it
Each of us has been taught to live up to the rule, and each of us knows about the social sanctions and derision applied to anyone who violates it
The labels we assign to such a person are loaded with negativity — moocher, ingrate, welsher
Because there is general distaste for those who take and make no effort to give in return, we will often go to great lengths to avoid being considered one of their number
It is to those lengths that we will often be taken and, in the process, be "taken" by individuals who stand to gain from our indebtedness
To understand how the rule for reciprocation can be exploited by one who recognizes it as the source of   it certainly is, we might closely examine an experiment performed by Professor Dennis Regan of Cornell University/ A subject who participated in the study found himself rating, along with another subject, the quality of some paintings as part of an experiment on "art appreciation." The other rater — we can call him Joe — was only posing as a fellow subject and was actually Dr
Regan's assistant
For our purposes, the experiment took place under two different conditions
In some cases, Joe did a small, unsolicited favor for the true subject
During a short rest period, he left the room for a couple of minutes and returned with two bottles of CocaCola, one for the subject and one for himself, saying, "I asked him [the experimenter] if I could get myself a Coke, and he said it was okay, so I bought one for you, too." In other cases, Joe did not provide the subject with a favor; he simply returned from the twominute break emptyhanded
In all other respects, however, Joe behaved identically
Later on, after the paintings had all been rated and the experimenter had momentarily left the room, Joe asked the subject to do him a favor
He indicated that he was selling raffle tickets for a new car and that if 16 /   he sold the most tickets, he would win a fiftydollar prize
Joe's request was for the subject to buy some raffle tickets at twentyfive cents apiece: "Any would help, the more the better." The major finding of the study concerns the number of tickets subjects purchased from Joe under the two conditions
Without question, Joe was more successful in selling his raffle tickets to the subjects who had received his earlier favor
Ap parently feeling that they owed him something, these subjects bought twice as many tickets as the subjects who had not been given the prior favor
Although the Regan study represents a fairly simple demonstra tion of the workings of the rule for reciprocation, it illustrates several important characteristics of the rule that, upon further consideration, help us to understand how it may be profitably used
The Rule Is Overpowering One of the reasons reciprocation can be used so effectively as a device for gaining another's compliance is its power
The rule possesses awe some strength, often producing a "yes" response to a request that, except for an existing feeling of indebtedness, would have surely been refused
Some evidence of how the rule's force can overpower the   of other factors that normally determine whether a request will be com plied with can be seen in a second result of the Regan study
Besides his interest in the impact of the reciprocity rule on compliance, Regan was also interested in how liking for a person affects the tendency to comply with that person's request
To measure how liking toward Joe affected the subjects' decisions to buy his raffle tickets, Regan had them fill out several rating scales indicating how much they liked Joe
He then compared their liking responses with the number of tickets they had purchased from Joe
There was a significant tendency for subjects to buy more raffle tickets from Joe the more they liked him
But this alone is hardly a startling finding
Most of us would have guessed that people are more willing to do a favor for someone they like
The interesting thing about the Regan experiment, however, is that the relationship between liking and compliance was completely wiped out in the condition under which subjects had been given a Coke by Joe
For those who owed him a favor, it made no difference whether they liked him or not; they felt a sense of obligation to repay him, and they did
The subjects in that condition who indicated that they disliked Joe bought just as many of his tickets as did those who indicated that they liked him
The rule for reciprocity was so strong that it simply overwhelmed the   of a factor — liking for the requester — that normally affects the decision to comply
Think of the implications
People we might ordinarily dislike — unsa   17 vory or unwelcome sales operators, disagreeable acquaintances, repres entatives of strange or unpopular organizations — can greatly increase the chance that we will do what they wish merely by providing us with a small favor prior to their requests
Let's take an example that by now many of us have encountered
The Hare Krishna Society is an Eastern religious sect with centuriesold roots traceable to the Indian city of Calcutta
But its spectacular modernday story occurred in the 1970s, when it experienced a remarkable growth not only in followers but also in wealth and property
The economic growth was funded through a variety of activities, the principal and still most visible of which is the request for donations by Society members from passersby in public places
During the early history of the group in this country, the solicit ation for contributions was attempted in a fashion memorable for anyone who saw it
Groups of Krishna devotees — often with shaved heads, and wearing illfitting robes, leg wrappings, beads, and bells — would canvass a city street, chanting and bobbing in unison while begging for funds
Although highly effective as a technique for gaining attention, this form of fundraising did not work especially well
The average Amer ican considered the Krishnas weird, to say the least, and was reluctant to provide money to support them
It quickly became clear to the Society that it had a considerable publicrelations problem
The people being asked for contributions did not like the way the members looked, dressed, or acted
Had the Society been an ordinary commercial organ ization, the solution would have been simple — change the things the public does not like
But the Krishnas are a religious organization; and the way members look, dress, and act is partially tied to religious factors
Because, in any denomination, religious factors are typically resistant to change because of worldly considerations, the Krishna leadership was faced with a real dilemma
On the one hand were beliefs, modes of dress, and hairstyles that had religious significance
On the other hand, threatening the organization's financial welfare, were the less thanpositive feelings of the American public toward these things
What's a sect to do? The Krishnas' resolution was brilliant
They switched to a fundraising tactic that made it unnecessary for target persons to have positive feel ings toward the fundraisers
They began to employ a donationrequest procedure that engaged the rule for reciprocation, which, as demon strated by the Regan study, is strong enough to overcome the factor of dislike for the requester
The new strategy still involves the solicitation of contributions in public places with much pedestrian traffic (airports are a favorite), but now, before a donation is requested, the target person is given a "gift" — a book (usually the Bhagavad Gita), the Back to Godhead 18 /   magazine of the Society, or, in the most costeffective version, a flower
The unsuspecting passerby who suddenly finds a flower pressed into his hands or pinned to his jacket is under no circumstances allowed to give it back, even if he asserts that he does not want it
"No, it is our gift to you," says the solicitor, refusing to accept it
Only after the Krishna member has thus brought the force of the reciprocation rule to bear on the situation is the target asked to provide a contribution to the Society
This benefactorbeforebeggar strategy has been wildly success ful for the Hare Krishna Society, producing largescale economic gains and funding the ownership of temples, businesses, houses, and property in 321 centers in the United States and overseas
As an aside, it is instructive that the reciprocation rule has begun to outlive its usefulness for the Krishnas, not because the rule itself is any less potent societally, but because we have found ways to prevent the Krishnas from using it on us
After once falling victim to their tactic, many travelers are now alert to the presence of robed Krishna Society solicitors in airports and train stations, adjusting their paths to avoid an encounter and preparing beforehand to ward off a solicitor's "gift." Although the Society has tried to counter this increased vigilance by instructing members to be dressed and groomed in modern styles to avoid immediate recognition when soliciting (some actually carry flight bags or suitcases), even disguise has not worked especially well for the Krishnas
Too many individuals now know better than to accept unrequested offerings in public places like airports
Furthermore, airport administrators have initiated a number of procedures designed to forewarn us of the Krishnas' true identity and intent
Thus, it is now common airport practice to restrict the Krishnas' soliciting activity to certain areas of the airport and to announce through signs and the public address system that the Krishnas are soliciting there
It is a test ament to the societal value of reciprocation that we have chosen to fight the Krishnas mostly by seeking to avoid rather than to withstand the force of their gift giving
The reciprocity rule that empowers their tactic is too strong — and socially beneficial — for us to want to violate it
Politics is another arena in which the power of the reciprocity rule shows itself
Reciprocation tactics appear at every level: • At the top, elected officials engage in "logrolling" and the exchange of favors that makes politics the place of strange bedfellows, indeed
The outofcharacter vote of one of our elected representatives on a bill or measure can often be understood as a favor returned to the bill's sponsor
Political analysts were amazed at Lyndon Johnson's ability to get so many of his programs through Congress during his early administration
Even members of congress who were thought   19 to be strongly opposed to the proposals were voting for them
Close examination by political scientists has found the cause to be not so much Johnson's political savvy as the large score of favors he had been able to provide to other legislators during his many years of power in the House and Senate
As President, he was able to produce a truly remarkable amount of legislation in a short time by calling in those favors
It is interesting that this same process may account for the problems Jimmy Carter had in getting his programs through Congress during his early administration, despite heavy Democratic majorities in both House and Senate
Carter came to the presidency from outside the Capitol Hill establishment
He campaigned on his outsideWashington identity, saying that he was indebted to no one there
Much of his legislative difficulty upon arriving may be traced to the fact that no one there was indebted to him
At another level, we can see the recognized strength of the reciprocity rule in the desire of corporations and individuals to provide judicial and legislative officials with gifts and favors, and in the series of legal restrictions against such gifts and favors
Even with legitimate political contributions, the stockpiling of obligations often underlies the stated purpose of supporting a favorite candidate
One look at the lists of companies and organizations that contribute to the cam paigns of both major candidates in important elections gives evidence of such motives
A skeptic, requiring direct evidence of the quid pro quo expected by political contributors, might look to the remarkably baldfaced admission by Charles H
Keating, Jr., who was later con victed on multiple counts of fraud in this country's savings and loan disaster
Addressing the question of whether a connection existed between the $1.3 million he had contributed to the campaigns of five U.S
senators and their subsequent actions in his behalf against federal regulators, he asserted, "I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so." At the grassroots level, local political organizations have learned that the principal way to keep their candidates in office is to make sure they provide a wide range of little favors to the voters
The "ward heelers" of many cities still operate effectively in this fashion
But ordinary citizens are not alone in trading political support for small personal favors
During the 1992 presidential primary campaign, actress Sally Kellerman was asked why she was lending her name and efforts to the candidacy of Democratic hopeful Jerry Brown
Her reply: "Twenty years ago, I asked ten friends to help me move
He was the only one who showed up." Of course, the power of reciprocity can be found in the merchandising 20 /   field as well
Although the number of possible examples is large, let's examine a pair of familiar ones deriving from the "free sample." As a marketing technique, the free sample has a long and effective history
In most instances, a small amount of the relevant product is provided to potential customers for the stated purpose of allowing them to try it to see if they like it
And certainly this is a legitimate desire of the manufacturer — to expose the public to the qualities of the product
The beauty of the free sample, however, is that it is also a gift and, as such, can engage the reciprocity rule
In true jujitsu fashion, the promoter who gives free samples can release the natural indebting force inherent in a gift while innocently appearing to have only the intention to inform
A favorite place for free samples is the supermarket, where customers are frequently provided with small cubes of a certain variety of cheese or meat to try
Many people find it difficult to accept a sample from the alwayssmiling attendant, return only the toothpick, and walk away
Instead, they buy some of the product, even if they might not have liked it especially well
A highly effective variation on this marketing proced ure is illustrated in the case, cited by Vance Packard in The Hidden Per suaders, of the Indiana supermarket operator who sold an astounding one thousand pounds of cheese in a few hours one day by putting out the cheese and inviting customers to cut off slivers for themselves as free samples
A different version of the freesample tactic is used by the Amway Corporation, a rapidgrowth company that manufactures and distributes household and personalcare products in a vast national network of doortodoor neighborhood sales
The company, which has grown from a basementrun operation a few years ago to a oneandahalfbillion dollaryearlysales business, makes use of the free sample in a device called the BUG
The BUG consists of a collection of Amway products — bottles of furniture polish, detergent, or shampoo, spray containers of deodorizers, insect killers, or window cleaners — carried to the customer's home in a specially designed tray or just a polyethyl ene bag
The confidential Amway Career Manual then instructs the salesperson to leave the BUG with the customer "for 24, 48, or 72 hours, at no cost or obligation to her
Just tell her you would like her to try the products...
That's an offer no one can refuse." At the end of the trial period, the Amway representative returns and picks up orders for those of the products the customer wishes to purchase
Since few customers use up the entire contents of even one of the product containers in such a short time, the salesperson may then take the remaining product portions in the BUG to the next potential customer down the line or across the street and start the process again
Many Amway representat ives have several BUGs circulating in their districts at one time
  21 Of course, by now you and I know that the customer who has accep ted and used the BUG products has been trapped into facing the influ ence of the reciprocity rule
Many such customers yield to a sense of obligation to order those of the salesperson's products that they have tried and thereby partially consumed
And, of course, by now the Am way Corporation knows that to be the case
Even in a company with as excellent a growth record as Amway, the BUG device has created a big stir
Reports by state distributors to the parent company record a remarkable effect: Unbelievable! We've never seen such excitement
Product is moving at an unbelievable rate, and we've only just begun...
[Local] distributors took the BUGS, and we've had an unbelievable increase in sales [from Illinois distributor]
The most fantastic retail idea we've ever had! 

.On the average, customers purchased about half the total amount of the BUG when it is picked up...
In one word, tremendous! We've never seen a response within our entire organization like this [from Massachusetts distributor]
The Amway distributors appear to be bewildered — happily so, but nonetheless bewildered — by the startling power of the BUG
Of course, by now you and I should not be
The reciprocity rule governs many situations of a purely interpersonal nature where neither money nor commercial exchange is at issue
Per haps my favorite illustration of the enormous force available from the reciprocation weapon of   comes from such a situation
The European scientist, EiblEibesfeldt, provides the account of a German soldier during World War I whose job was to capture enemy soldiers for interrogation
Because of the nature of the trench warfare at that time, it was extremely difficult for armies to cross the noman' sland between opposing front lines; but it was not so difficult for a single soldier to crawl across and slip into an enemy trench position
The armies of the Great War had experts who regularly did so to capture an enemy soldier, who would then be brought back for questioning
The German expert of our account had often successfully completed such missions in the past and was sent on another
Once again, he skillfully negotiated the area between fronts and surprised a lone enemy soldier in his trench
The unsuspecting soldier, who had been eating at the time, was easily disarmed
The frightened captive with only a piece of bread in his hand then performed what may have been the most important act of his life
He gave his enemy some of the bread
So af fected was the German by this gift that he could not complete his mis sion
He turned from his benefactor and recrossed the noman' sland emptyhanded to face the wrath of his superiors
22 /   An equally compelling point regarding the power of reciprocity comes from an account of a woman who saved her life not by giving a gift as did the captured soldier, but by refusing a gift and the powerful obliga tions that went with it
The woman, Diane Louie, was an inhabitant of Jonestown, Guyana, in November of 1978 when its leader, Jim Jones, called for the mass suicide of all residents, most of whom compliantly drank and died from a vat of poisonlaced KoolAid
Diane Louie, however, rejected Jones's command and made her way out of Jonestown and into the jungle
She attributes her willingness to do so to her earlier refusal to accept special favors from him when she was in need
She turned down his offer of special food while she was ill because "I knew once he gave me those privileges, he'd have me
I didn't want to owe him nothin'." The Rule Enforces Uninvited Debts Earlier we suggested that the power of the reciprocity rule is such that by first doing us a favor, strange, disliked, or unwelcome others can enhance the chance that we will comply with one of their requests
However, there is another aspect of the rule, besides its power, that al lows this phenomenon to occur
Another person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an uninvited favor
Recall that the rule only states that we should provide to others the kind of actions they have provided us; it does not require us to have asked for what we have received in order to feel obligated to repay
For instance, the Disabled American Veterans organization reports that its simple mail appeal for donations produces a response rate of about 18 percent
But when the mailing also includes an unsolicited gift (gummed, individualized ad dress labels), the success rate nearly doubles to 35 percent
This is not to say that we might not feel a stronger sense of obligation to return a favor we have requested, only that such a request is not necessary to produce our indebtedness
If we reflect for a moment about the social purpose of the reciprocity rule, we can see why this should be so
The rule was established to promote the development of reciprocal relationships between individu als so that one person could initiate such a relationship without the fear of loss
If the rule is to serve that purpose, then, an uninvited first favor must have the ability to create an obligation
Recall, also, that reciprocal relationships confer an extraordinary advantage upon cultures that foster them and that, consequently, there will be strong pressures to ensure that the rule does serve its purpose
Little wonder, then, that the influential French anthropologist Marcel Mauss, in describing the social pressures surrounding the giftgiving process in human culture
  23 can state, "There is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay." 6 Although the obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the reci procity rule, it is the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit
The obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose whom we wish to be indebted to and puts that power in the hands of others
Let's reexamine a pair of earlier examples to get a sense of how the process works
First, let's return to the Regan study, where we find that the favor causing subjects to double the number of raffle tickets pur chased from Joe was not one they had requested
Joe had voluntarily left the room and returned with one Coke for himself and one for the subject
There was not a single subject who refused the Coke
It is easy to see why it would have been awkward to turn down Joe's favor: Joe had already spent his money; a soft drink was an appropriate favor in the situation, especially since Joe had one himself; it would have been considered impolite to reject Joe's thoughtful action
Nevertheless, re ceipt of that Coke produced an indebtedness that manifested itself clearly when Joe announced his desire to sell some raffle tickets
Notice the important asymmetry here — all the genuinely free choices were Joe's
He chose the form of the initial favor, and he chose the form of the return favor
Of course, one could say that the subject had the choice of saying no to both of Joe's offers
But those would have been tough choices
To have said no at either point would have required the subject to go against the natural cultural forces favoring reciprocation arrange ments that Jujitsu Joe had aligned himself with
The extent to which even an unwanted favor, once received, can produce indebtedness is aptly illustrated in the soliciting technique of the Hare Krishna Society
During systematic observation of the airport soliciting strategy of the Krishnas, I have recorded a variety of responses from target persons
One of the most regular occurs as follows
An air port visitor — a businessman, let's say — is hurriedly walking along through a densely peopled area
The Krishna solicitor steps in front of him and hands him a flower
The man, reacting with surprise, takes it/ Almost immediately, he tries to give it back, saying that he does not want the flower
The Krishna member responds that it is a gift from the Krishna Society and that it is the man's to keep 

.however, a donation to further the Society's good works would be appreciated
Again the target protests, "I don't want this flower
Here, take it." And again the solicitor refuses, "It's our gift to you, sir." There is visible conflict on the businessman's face
Should he keep the flower and walk away without giving anything in return, or slrould he yield to the pressure of the deeply ingrained reciprocity rule and provide a contribution? By now, the conflict has spread from his face to his posture
He leans away 24 /   from his benefactor, seemingly about to break free, only to be drawn back again by the pull of the rule
Once more his body tilts away, but it's no use; he cannot disengage
With a nod of resignation, he fishes in his pocket and comes up with a dollar or two that is graciously accepted
Now he can walk away freely, and he does, "gift" in hand, until he en counters a waste container — where he throws the flower
Purely by accident, I happened to witness a scene that demonstrates that the Krishnas know very well how frequently their gifts are un wanted by the people who receive them
While spending a day ob serving a soliciting Krishna group at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport a few years ago, I noticed that one of the group members would frequently leave the central area and return with more flowers to resup ply her companions
As it happened, I had decided to take a break just as she was leaving on one of her supply missions
Having nowhere to go, I followed
Her journey turned out to be a garbage route
She went from trash can to trash can beyond the immediate area to retrieve all the flowers that had been discarded by Krishna targets
She then re turned with the cache of recovered flowers (some that had been recycled who knows how many times) and distributed them to be profitably cycled through the reciprocation process once more
The thing that really impressed me about all this was that most of the discarded flowers had brought donations from the people who had cast them away
The nature of the reciprocity rule is such that a gift so unwanted that it was jettisoned at the first opportunity had nonetheless been effective and exploitable
The ability of uninvited gifts to produce feelings of obligation is re cognized by a variety of organizations besides the Krishnas
How many times have each of us received small gifts through the mail — personal ized address labels, greeting cards, key rings — from charity agencies that ask for funds in an accompanying note? I have received five in just the past year, two from disabled veterans' groups and the others from missionary schools or hospitals
In each case, there was a common thread in the accompanying message
The goods that were enclosed were to be considered a gift from the organization; and any money I wished to send should not be regarded as payment but rather as a return offering
As the letter from one of the missionary programs stated, the packet of greeting cards I had been sent was not to be directly paid for, but was designed "to encourage your kindness." If we look past the obvious tax advantage, we can see a reason why it would be beneficial for the organization to have the cards viewed as a gift instead of mer chandise: There is a strong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even an unwanted one; but there is no such pressure to purchase an unwanted commercial product
  25 The Rule Can Trigger Unfair Exchanges There is yet one other feature of the reciprocity rule that allows it to be exploited for profit
Paradoxically, the rule developed to promote equal exchanges between partners, yet it can be used to bring about decidedly unequal results
The rule demands that one sort of action be reciprocated with a similar sort of action
A favor is to be met with another favor; it is not to be met with neglect, and certainly not with attack
But within the similaraction boundaries, considerable flexibility is allowed
A small initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a sub stantially larger return favor
Since, as we have already seen, the rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor and the nature of the debtcanceling return favor, we could easily be manip ulated into an unfair exchange by those who might wish to exploit the rule
Once again, we can turn to the Regan experiment for evidence
Re member in that study that Joe gave one group of subjects a bottle of CocaCola as an initiating gift and later asked all subjects to buy some of his raffle tickets at twentyfive cents apiece
What I have so far neg lected to mention is that the study was done in the late 1960s, when the price of a Coke was a dime
The average subject who had been given a tencent drink bought two of Joe's raffle tickets, although some bought as many as seven
Even if we look just at the average subject, though, we can tell that Joe made quite a deal
A 500 percent return on invest ment is respectable indeed! But in Joe's case, even a 500 percent return amounted to only fifty cents
Can the reciprocity rule produce meaningfully large differences in the sizes of the exchanged favors? Under the right circumstances, it certainly can
Take, for instance, the account of a student of mine con cerning a day she remembers ruefully: About one year ago, I couldn't start my car
As I was sitting there, a guy in the parking lot came over and eventually jumpstarted the car
I said thanks, and he said you're welcome; as he was leaving, I said that if he ever needed a favor to stop by
About a month later, the guy knocked on my door and asked to borrow my car for two hours as his was in the shop
I felt somewhat oblig ated but uncertain, since the car was pretty new and he looked very young
Later, I found out that he was underage and had no insurance
Anyway, I lent him the car
He totaled it
How could it happen that an intelligent young woman would agree to turn over her new car to a virtual stranger (and a youngster at that) 26 /   because he had done her a small favor a month earlier? Or, more gen erally, why should it be that small first favors often stimulate larger return favors? One important reason concerns the clearly unpleasant character of the feeling of indebtedness
Most of us find it highly dis agreeable to be in a state of obligation
It weighs heavily on us and de mands to be removed
It is not difficult to trace the source of this feeling
Because reciprocal arrangements are so vital in human social systems, we have been conditioned to be uncomfortable when beholden
If we were to ignore breezily the need to return another's initial favor, we would stop one reciprocal sequence dead and would make it less likely that our benefactor would do such favors in the future
Neither event is in the best interests of society
Consequently, we are trained from childhood to chafe, emotionally, under the saddle of obligation
For this reason alone, then, we may be willing to agree to perform a larger favor than we received, merely to relieve ourselves of the psychological burden of debt
But there is another reason as well
A person who violates the reci procity rule by accepting without attempting to return the good acts of others is actively disliked by the social group
The exception, of course, is when the person is prevented from repayment by reasons of circum stance or ability
For the most part, however, there is a genuine distaste for individuals who fail to conform to the dictates of the reciprocity rule
8 Moocher and welsher are unsavory labels to be scrupulously shunned
So undesirable are they that we will sometimes agree to an unequal exchange in order to dodge them
In combination, the reality of internal discomfort and the possibility of external shame can produce a heavy psychological cost
When seen in the light of this cost, it is not so puzzling that we will often give back more than we have received in the name of reciprocity
Neither is it so odd that, as was shown in an experiment conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, people will often avoid asking for a needed favor if they will not be in a position to repay it
The psychological cost may simply outweigh the material loss
The risk of still other kinds of losses may also persuade people to decline certain gifts and benefits
Women frequently comment on the uncomfortable sense of obligation they can feel to return the favors of a man who has given them an expensive present or paid for a costly evening out
Even something as small as the price of a drink can produce a feeling of debt
A student in one of my classes expressed it quite plainly in a paper she wrote: "After learning the hard way, I no longer let a guy I meet in a club buy my drinks because I don't want either of us to feel that I am obligated sexually." Research suggests that there is a basis for her concern
If, instead of paying for them herself, a woman   27 allows a man to buy her drinks, she is immediately judged (by both men and women) as more sexually available to him
9 RECIPROCAL CONCESSIONS There is a second way to employ the reciprocity rule to get someone to comply with a request
It is more subtle than the direct route of providing that person with a favor and then asking for one in return; yet in some ways it is more devastatingly effective than the straightfor ward approach
A personal experience I had a few years ago gave me firsthand evidence of just how well this compliance technique works
I was walking down the street when I was approached by an eleven or twelveyearold boy
He introduced himself and said that he was selling tickets to the annual Boy Scouts circus to be held on the upcoming Saturday night
He asked if I wished to buy any at five dollars apiece
Since one of the last places I wanted to spend Saturday evening was with the Boy Scouts, I declined
"Well," he said, "if you don't want to buy any tickets, how about buying some of our big chocolate bars? They're only a dollar each." I bought a couple and, right away, realized that something noteworthy had happened
I knew that to be the case because: (a) I do not like chocolate bars; (b) I do like dollars; (c) I was standing there with two of his chocolate bars; and (d) he was walking away with two of my dollars
To try to understand precisely what had happened, I went to my office and called a meeting of my research assistants
In discussing the situ ation, we began to see how the reciprocity rule was implicated in my compliance with the request to buy the candy bars
The general rule says that a person who acts in a certain way toward us is entitled to a similar return action
We have already seen that one consequence of the rule is an obligation to repay favors we have received
Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us
As my research group thought about it, we realized that was exactly the position the Boy Scout had put me in
His request that I purchase some onedollar chocolate bars had been put in the form of a concession on his part; it was presented as a retreat from his request that I buy some fivedollar tickets
If I were to live up to the dictates of the reciprocation rule, there had to be a concession on my part
As we have seen, there was such a conces sion: I changed from noncompliant to compliant when he changed from a larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in either of the things he offered
It was a classic example of how a weapon of automatic   can infuse a compliance request with its power
I had been moved to buy 28 /   something not because of any favorable feelings toward the item, but because the purchase request had been presented in a way that drew force from the reciprocity rule
It had not mattered that I do not like chocolate bars; the Boy Scout had made a concession to me, click, and, whirr, I responded with a concession of my own
Of course, the tendency to reciprocate a concession is not so strong that it will invariably work in all instances on all people; none of the weapons of   con sidered in this book is that strong
However, in my exchange with the Boy Scout, the tendency had been sufficiently potent to leave me in mystified possession of a pair of unwanted and overpriced candy bars
Why should I feel a strain to reciprocate a concession? The answer rests once again in the benefit of such a tendency to the society
It is in the interests of any human group to have its members working together toward the achievement of common goals
However, in many social interactions the participants begin with requirements and demands that are unacceptable to one another
Thus the society must arrange to have these initial, incompatible desires set aside for the sake of socially beneficial cooperation
This is accomplished through procedures that promote compromise
Mutual concession is one important such proced ure
The reciprocation rule brings about mutual concession in two ways
The first is obvious
It pressures the recipient of an alreadymade con cession to respond in kind
The second, while not so obvious, is pivotally important
Just as in the case of favors, gifts, or aid, the obligation to reciprocate a concession encourages the creation of socially desirable arrangements by ensuring that anyone seeking to start such an arrange ment will not be exploited
After all, if there were no social obligation to reciprocate a concession, who would want to make the first sacrifice? To do so would be to risk giving up something and getting nothing back
However, with the rule in effect, we can feel safe making the first sacrifice to our partner, who is obligated to offer a return sacrifice
Because the rule for reciprocation governs the compromise process, it is possible to use an initial concession as part of a highly effective compliance technique
The technique is a simple one that we can call the rejectionthenretreat technique
Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request
One way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down
Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along
Provided that you have structured your requests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own
  29 the only one I would have immediately open to me — compliance with your second request
Was that how the Boy Scout got me to buy his candy bars? Was his retreat from the fivedollar request to the onedollar request an artificial one that was intentionally designed to sell candy bars? As one who has still refused to discard even his first Scout merit badge, I genuinely hope not
But whether or not the largerequestthensmallerrequest sequence was planned, its effect was the same
It worked
And because it works, the rejectionthenretreat technique can and will be used pur posely by certain people to get their way
First let's examine how this tactic can be used as a reliable compliance device
Later we will see how it is already being used
Finally we can turn to a pair of littleknown features of the technique that make it one of the most pervasively influ ential compliance tactics available
Remember that after my encounter with the Boy Scout, I called my research assistants together to try to understand what had happened to me and, as it turned out, to eat the evidence
Actually, we did more than that
We designed an experiment to test the effectiveness of the procedure of moving to a desired request after a larger preliminary re quest had been refused
We had two primary purposes in conducting the experiment
First, we wanted to see whether this procedure worked on people besides myself
That is, it certainly seemed that the tactic had been effective when tried on me earlier in the day; but then, I have a history of falling for compliance tricks of all sorts
So the question re mained, Does the rejectionthenretreat technique work on enough people to make it a useful procedure for gaining compliance? If so, it would definitely be something to be aware of in the future
Our second reason for doing the study was to determine how powerful a compliance device the technique was
Could it bring about compliance with a genuinely sizable request? In other words, did the smaller request to which the requester retreated have to be a small re quest? If our thinking about what caused the technique to be effective was correct, the second request did not actually have to be small; it only had to be smaller than the initial one
It was our suspicion that the critical thing about a requester's retreat from a larger to a smaller favor was its appearance as a concession
So the second request could be an objectively large one — as long as it was smaller than the first re quest — and the technique would still work
After a bit of thought, we decided to try the technique on a request that we felt few people would agree to perform
Posing as representat ives of the "County Youth Counseling Program," we approached college students walking on campus and asked if they would be willing to chaperon a group of juvenile delinquents on a day trip to the zoo
The 30 /   idea of being responsible for a group of juvenile delinquents of unspe cified age for hours in a public place without pay was hardly an inviting one for these students
As we expected, the great majority (83 percent) refused
Yet we obtained very different results from a similar sample of college students who were asked the very same question with one difference
Before we invited them to serve as unpaid chaperons on the zoo trip, we asked them for an even larger favor — to spend two hours per week as a counselor to a juvenile delinquent for a minimum of two years
It was only after they refused this extreme request, as all did, that we made the smaller, zootrip request
By presenting the zoo trip as a retreat from our initial request, our success rate increased dramat ically
Three times as many of the students approached in this manner volunteered to serve as zoo chaperons
10 Be assured that any strategy able to triple the percentage of compli ance with a substantial request (from 17 percent to 50 percent in our experiment) will be frequently employed in a variety of natural settings
Labor negotiators, for instance, often use the tactic of beginning with extreme demands that they do not actually expect to win but from which they can retreat in a series of seeming concessions designed to draw real concessions from the opposing side
It would appear, then, that the larger the initial request, the more effective the procedure, since there would be more room available for illusory concessions
This is true only up to a point, however
Research conducted at BarIlan Uni versity in Israel on the rejectionthenretreat technique shows that if the first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic backfires
In such cases, the party who has made the extreme first request is not seen to be bargaining in good faith
Any subsequent retreat from that wholly unrealistic initial position is not viewed as a genuine concession and thus is not reciprocated
The truly gifted nego tiator, then, is one whose initial position is exaggerated enough to allow for a series of reciprocal concessions that will yield a desirable final offer from the opponent, yet is not so outlandish as to be seen as illegitimate from the start
It seems that certain of the most successful television producers, such as Grant Tinker and Gary Marshall, are masters of this art in their nego tiations with network censors
In a candid interview with TV Guide writer Dick Russell, both admitted to "deliberately inserting lines into scripts that a censor's sure to ax" so that they could then retreat to the lines they really wanted included
Marshall appears especially active in this regard
Consider, for example, the following quotes from Russell's article:   31 But Mar shall..
not only admits his tricks..
he seems to revel in them
On one episode of his [then] toprated Laverne and Shirley series, for example, he says, "We had a situation where Squiggy's in a rush to get out of his apartment and meet some girls upstairs
He says: 'Will you hurry up before I lose my lust?' But in the script we put something even stronger, knowing the censors would cut it
They did; so we asked innocently, well, how about 'lose my lust'? 'That's good/ they said
Sometimes you gotta go at 'em backward." On the Happy Days series, the biggest censorship fight was over the word "virgin." That time, says Marshall, "I knew we'd have trouble, so we put the word in seven times, hoping they'd cut six and keep one
It worked
We used the same pattern again with the word 'pregnant.'" I witnessed another form of the rejection thenretreat technique in my investigations of doortodoor sales operations
These organizations used a less engineered, more opportunistic version of the tactic
Of course, the most important goal for a doortodoor salesperson is to make the sale
However, the training programs of each of the companies I investigated emphasized that a second important goal was to obtain from prospects the names of referrals — friends, relatives, or neighbors on whom we could call
For a variety of reasons we will discuss in Chapter 5, the percentage of successful doortodoor sales increases impressively when the sales operator is able to mention the name of a familiar person who "recommended" the sales visit
Never as a sales trainee was I taught to get the sales pitch refused so that I could then retreat to a request for referrals
In several such pro grams, though, I was trained to take advantage of the opportunity to secure referrals offered by a customer's purchase refusal: "Well, if it is your feeling that a fine set of encyclopedias is not right for you at this time, perhaps you could help me by giving me the names of some others who might wish to take advantage of our company's great offer
What would be the names of some of these people you know?" Many indi viduals who would not otherwise subject their friends to a highpressure sales presentation do agree to supply referrals when the request is presented as a concession from a purchase request they have just re fused
We have already discussed one reason for the success of the rejection thenretreat technique — its incorporation of the reciprocity rule
This largerthensmallerrequest strategy is effective for a pair of other reasons as well
The first concerns the perceptual contrast principle we 32 /   encountered in Chapter 1
That principle accounted for, among other things, the tendency of a man to spend more money on a sweater fol lowing his purchase of a suit than before: After being exposed to the price of the large item, the price of the less expensive one appears smaller by comparison
In the same way, the largerthensmallerrequest pro cedure makes use of the contrast principle by making the smaller request look even smaller by comparison with the larger one
If I want you to lend me five dollars, I can make it seem like a smaller request by first asking you to lend me ten dollars
One of the beauties of this tactic is that by first requesting ten dollars and then retreating to five dollars, I will have simultaneously engaged the force of the reciprocity rule and the contrast principle
Not only will my fivedollar request be viewed as a concession to be reciprocated, it will also look to you like a smaller request than if I had just asked for it straightaway
In combination, the  s of reciprocity and perceptual contrast can present a fearsomely powerful force
Embodied in the rejection thenretreat sequence, their conjoined energies are capable of genuinely astonishing effects
It is my feeling that they provide the only really plausible explanation of one of the most baffling political actions of our time: the decision to break into the Watergate offices of the Democratic National Committee that led to the ruin of Richard Nixon's presidency
One of the participants in that decision, Jeb Stuart Magruder, upon first hearing that the Watergate burglars had been caught, responded with appropriate bewilderment, "How could we have been so stupid?" In deed, how? To understand how enormously ill conceived an idea it was for the Nixon administration to undertake the breakin, it is necessary to review a few facts: • The idea was that of G
Gordon Liddy, who was in charge of intelli gencegathering operations for the Committee to Reelect the Presid ent (CRP)
Liddy had gained a reputation among administration higherups as something of a flake, and there were questions about his stability and judgment
• Liddy's proposal was extremely costly, requiring a budget of $250,000 in untraceable cash
• In late March, when the proposal was approved in a meeting of the CRP director, John Mitchell, and his assistants Magruder and Freder ick LaRue, the outlook for a Nixon victory in the November election could not have been brighter
Edmund Muskie, the only announced candidate the early polls had given a chance of unseating the Presid ent, had done poorly in the primaries
It looked very much as though   33 the most defeatable candidate, George McGovern, would win his party's nomination
A Republican victory seemed assured
• The breakin plan itself was a highly risky operation requiring the participation and discretion of ten men
• The Democratic National Committee and its chairman, Lawrence O'Brien, whose Watergate office was to be burglarized and bugged, had no information damaging enough to defeat the incumbent Pres ident
Nor were they likely to get any, unless the administration did something very, very foolish
Despite the obvious counsel of the above reasons, the expensive, chancy, pointless, and potentially calamitous proposal of a man whose judgment was known to be questionable was approved
How could it be that intelligent men of the attainment of Mitchell and Magruder would do something so very, very foolish? Perhaps the answer lies in a littlediscussed fact: The $250,000 plan they approved was not Liddy's first proposal
In fact, it represented a significant concession on his part from two earlier proposals, of immense proportions
The first of these plans, made two months earlier in a meeting with Mitchell, Magruder, and John Dean, described a $1 million program that included (in addition to the bugging of the Watergate) a specially equipped communications "chase plane," breakins, kidnapping and mugging squads, and a yacht featuring "highclass call girls" to blackmail Democratic politicians
A second Liddy plan, presented a week later to the same group of Mitchell, Magruder, and Dean, eliminated some of the program and reduced the cost to $500,000
It was only after these initial proposals had been rejec ted by Mitchell that Liddy submitted his "barebones" $250,000 plan, in this instance to Mitchell, Magruder, and Frederick LaRue
This time the plan, still stupid but less so than the previous ones, was approved
Could it be that I, a longtime patsy, and John Mitchell, a hardened and canny politician, might both have been so easily maneuvered into bad deals by the same compliance tactic — I by a Boy Scout selling candy, and he by a man selling political disaster? If we examine the testimony of Jeb Magruder, considered by most Watergate investigators to provide the most faithful account of the crucial meeting at which Liddy's plan was finally accepted, there are some instructive clues
First, Magruder reports that "no one was partic ularly overwhelmed with the project"; but "after starting at the grandi ose sum of $1 million, we thought that probably $250,000 would be an acceptable figure ...
We were reluctant to send him away with nothing
" Mitchell, caught up in the "feeling that we should leave Liddy a little something

.signed off on it in the sense of saying, 'Okay, let's give him a quarter of a million dollars and let's see what he can come up with.'" 34 /   In the context of Liddy's initial extreme requests, it seems that "a quarter of a million dollars" had come to be "a little something" to be left as a return concession
With the clarity afforded by hindsight, Ma gruder has recalled Liddy's approach in as succinct an illustration of the rejectionthenretreat technique as I have ever heard
"If he had come to us at the outset and said, 'I have a plan to burglarize and wiretap Larry O'Brien's office,' we might have rejected the idea out of hand
Instead he came to us with his elaborate callgirl /kidnap ping/mugging/sabotage/wiretapping scheme

.
He had asked for the whole loaf when he was quite content to settle for half or even a quarter." 13 It is also instructive that, although he finally deferred to his boss's decision, only one member of the group, Frederick LaRue, expressed any direct opposition to the proposal
Saying with obvious common sense, "I don't think it's worth the risk," he must have wondered why his colleagues Mitchell and Magruder did not share his perspective
Of course, there could be many differences between LaRue and the other two men that may have accounted for their differing opinions regarding the advisability of Liddy's plan
But one stands out: Of the three, only LaRue had not been present at the prior two meetings, where Liddy had outlined his much more ambitious programs
Perhaps, then, only LaRue was able to see the third proposal for the clunker that it was and to react to it objectively, un d by the reciprocity and perceptual contrast forces acting upon the others
A bit earlier we said that the rejection thenretreat technique had, in addition to the reciprocity rule, a pair of other factors working in its favor
We have already discussed the first of those factors, the percep tual contrast principle
The additional advantage of the technique is not really a psychological principle, as in the case of the other two factors; it is more of a purely structural feature of the request sequence
Let's once again say that I wish to borrow five dollars from you
By beginning with a tendollar request, I really can't lose
If you agree to it, I will have gotten twice the amount from you I would have settled for
If, on the other hand, you turn down my initial request, I can retreat to the fivedollar favor that I desired from the outset and, through the action of the reciprocity and contrast principles, greatly enhance my likelihood of success
Either way, I benefit; it's a case of heads I win, tails you lose
The clearest utilization of this aspect of the largerthensmallerrequest sequence occurs in the retailstore sales practice of "talking the top of the line." Here the prospect is invariably shown the deluxe model first
If the customer buys, there is frosting on the store's cake
However, if the customer declines, the salesperson effectively counteroffers with a   35 more reasonably priced model
Some proof of the effectiveness of this procedure comes from a report in Sales Management magazine, reprinted without comment in Consumer Reports: If you were a billiardtable dealer, which would you advertise — the $329 model or the $3,000 model? The chances are you would pro mote the lowpriced item and hope to trade the customer up when he comes to buy
But G
Warren Kelley, new business promotion manager at Brunswick, says you could be wrong
..
To prove his point, Kelley has actual sales figures from a representative store



During the first week, customers

.were shown the low end of the line..
and then encouraged to consider more expensive mod els — the traditional tradingup approach

.
The average table sale that week was $550 ...
However, during the second week, custom ers..
were led instantly to a $3,000 table, regardless of what they wanted to see..
and then allowed to shop the rest of the line, in declining order of price and quality
The result of selling down was an average sale of over $1,000
Given the remarkable effectiveness of the rejection thenretreat technique, one might think that there could be a substantial disadvant age as well
The victims of the strategy might resent having been cornered into compliance
The resentment could show itself in a couple of ways
First, the victim might decide not to live up to the verbal agreement made with the requester
Second, the victim might come to distrust the manipulative requester, deciding never to deal with him again
If either or both of these events occurred with any frequency, a requester would want to give serious second thought to the use of the rejectionthenretreat procedure
Research indicates, however, that these victim reactions do not occur with increased frequency when the rejec tionthenretreat technique is used
Somewhat astonishingly, it appears that they actually occur less frequently! Before trying to understand why this is the case, let's first look at the evidence
A study published in Canada throws light on the question of whether a victim of the rejectionthenretreat tactic will follow through with the agreement to perform the requester's second favor
In addition to recording whether target persons said yes or no to the desired request (to work for two unpaid hours one day in a community mentalhealth agency), this experiment also recorded whether they showed up to perform their duties as promised
As usual, the procedure of starting with a larger request (to volunteer for two hours of work per week in the agency for at least two years) produced more verbal agreement to the smaller retreat request (76 percent) than did the procedure of asking for the smaller request alone (29 percent)
The important result, though
36 /   concerned the showup rate of those who volunteered; and, again, the re jectionthenretreat procedure was the more effective one (85 percent vs
50 percent)
15 A different experiment examined whether the rejectionthenretreat sequence caused victims to feel so manipulated that they would refuse any further requests
In this study, the targets were college students who were each asked to give a pint of blood as part of the annual cam pus blood drive
One group of targets was first asked to give a pint of blood every six weeks for a minimum of three years
The other targets were asked only to give the single pint of blood
Those of both groups who agreed to give a pint of blood and who later appeared at the blood center were then asked if they would be willing to give their phone numbers so they could be called upon to donate again in the future
Nearly all the students who were about to give a pint of blood as a result of the rejectionthenretreat technique agreed to donate again later (84 percent), while less than half of the other students who ap peared at the blood center did so (43 percent)
Even for future favors, the rejection thenretreat strategy proved superior
16 Strangely enough, then, it seems that the rejectionthenretreat tactic spurs people not only to agree to a desired request but actually to carry out the request and, finally, to volunteer to perform further requests
What could there be about the technique that makes people who have been duped into compliance so bewilderingly likely to continue to comply? For an answer, we might look at the requester's act of conces sion, which is the heart of the procedure
We have already seen that as long as it is not viewed to be a transparent trick, the concession will likely stimulate a return concession
But what we have not yet examined is a littleknown pair of positive byproducts of the act of concession: feelings of greater responsibility for, and satisfaction with, the arrange ment
It is this set of sweet side effects that enables the technique to move its victims to fulfill their agreements and to engage in further such agreements
The desirable side effects of making a concession during an interaction with another person are nicely shown in studies of the way people bargain with each other
One experiment, conducted by social psycho logists at UCLA, offers an especially apt demonstration
17 A subject in that study faced a "negotiation opponent" and was told to bargain with the opponent concerning how to divide between themselves a certain amount of money provided by the experimenters
The subject was also informed that if no mutual agreement could be reached after a certain period of bargaining, no one would get any money
Unknown to the subjects, the opponent was really an experimental assistant who had   37 been previously instructed to bargain with the subject in one of three ways
With some of the subjects, the opponent made an extreme first demand, assigning virtually all of the money to himself, and stubbornly persisted in that demand throughout the negotiations
With another group of subjects, the opponent began with a demand that was moder ately favorable to himself; he, too, steadfastly refused to move from that position during the negotiations
With a third group, the opponent began with the extreme demand and then gradually retreated to the more moderate one during the course of the bargaining
There were three important findings in this experiment that help us to understand why the rejection thenretreat technique is so effective
First, compared to the two other approaches, the strategy of starting with an extreme demand and then retreating to the more moderate one produced the most money for the person using it
But this result is not very surprising in light of the previous evidence we have seen of the power of largerthensmallerrequest tactics to bring about profitable agreements
It is the two additional findings of the study that are more striking
Responsibility
Those subjects facing the opponent who used the re treating strategy felt most responsible for the final deal
Much more than the subjects who faced a nonchanging negotiation opponent, these subjects reported that they had successfully  d the opponent to take less money for himself
Of course, we know that they hadn't done any such thing
The experimenter had instructed their opponent to retreat gradually from his initial demand no matter what the subjects did
But it appeared to these subjects that they had made the opponent change, that they had produced his concessions
The result was that they felt more responsible for the final outcome of the negotiations
It does not require much of a leap from this finding to clarify the previous mystery of why the rejection thenretreat technique causes its targets to live up to their agreements with such astounding frequency
The re quester's concession within the technique not only causes targets to say yes more often, it also causes them to feel more responsible for having "dictated" the final agreement
Thus the uncanny ability of the rejection thenretreat technique to make its targets meet their commitments be comes understandable: A person who feels responsible for the terms of a contract will be more likely to live up to that contract
Satisfaction
Even though, on the average, they gave the most money to the opponent who used the concessions strategy, the subjects who were the targets of this strategy were the most satisfied with the final arrangement
It appears that an agreement that has been forged through the concessions of one's opponent is quite satisfying
With this in mind, we can begin to explain the second previously puzzling feature of the 38 /   rejectionthenretreat tactic — the ability to prompt its victims to agree to further requests
Since the tactic uses a concession to bring about compliance, the victim is likely to feel more satisfied with the arrange ment as a result
And it stands to reason that people who are satisfied with a given arrangement are more likely to be willing to agree to further such arrangements
HOW TO SAY NO When up against a requester who employs the rule for reciprocation, you and I face a formidable foe
Whether by presenting us with an initial favor or initial concession, the requester will have enlisted a powerful ally in the campaign for our compliance
At first glance, our fortunes in such a situation would appear dismal
We could comply with the requester's wish and, in so doing, succumb to the reciprocity rule
Or, we could refuse to comply and thereby suffer the brunt of the rule's force upon our deeply conditioned feelings of fairness and obligation
Surrender or suffer heavy casualties
Cheerless prospects indeed
Fortunately, these are not our only choices
With the proper under standing of the nature of our opponent, we can come away from the compliance battlefield unhurt and sometimes even better off than before
It is essential to recognize that the requester who invokes the reciproc ation rule (or any other weapon of  ) to gain our compliance is not the real opponent
Such a requester has chosen to become a jujitsu warrior who aligns himself with the sweeping power of reciprocation and then merely releases that power by providing a first favor or con cession
The real opponent is the rule
If we are not to be abused by it, we must take steps to defuse its energy
But how does one go about neutralizing the effect of a social rule like that for reciprocation? It seems too widespread to escape and too strong to overpower once it is activated
Perhaps the answer, then, is to prevent its activation
Perhaps we can avoid a confrontation with the rule by refusing to allow the requester to commission its force against us in the first place
Perhaps by rejecting the requester's initial favor or concession to us, we can evade the problem
Perhaps; but then, perhaps not
Invari ably declining the requester's initial offer of a favor or sacrifice works better in theory than in practice
The major problem is that when it is first presented, it is difficult to know whether such an offer is honest or whether it is the initial step in an exploitation attempt
If we always assume the worst, it would not be possible to receive the benefits of any legitimate favors or concessions offered by individuals who had no intention of exploiting the reciprocity rule
I have a colleague who remembers with anger how his tenyearold   39 daughter's feelings were terribly hurt by a man whose method of avoiding the jaws of the reciprocity rule was to refuse abruptly her kindness
The children of her class were hosting an open house at school for their grandparents, and her job was to give a flower to each visitor entering the school grounds
But the first man she approached with a flower growled at her, "Keep it." Not knowing what to do, she extended it toward him again only to have him demand to know what he had to give in return
When she replied weakly, "Nothing
It's a gift," he fixed her with a disbelieving glare, insisted that he recognized "her game," and brushed on past
The girl was so stung by the experience that she could not approach anyone else and had to be removed from her assign ment — one she had anticipated fondly
It is hard to know whom to blame more here, the insensitive man or the exploiters who had abused his mechanical tendency to reciprocate a gift until his response had soured to a mechanical refusal
No matter whom you find more blameworthy, the lesson is clear
We will always encounter authentically generous individuals as well as many people who try to play fairly by the reciprocity rule rather than to exploit it
They will doubtless become insulted by someone who consistently rejects their efforts; social friction and isolation could well result
A policy of blanket rejection, then, seems ill advised
Another solution holds more promise
It advises us to accept the de sirable first offers of others but to accept those offers only for what they fundamentally are, not for what they are represented to be
If a person offers us a nice favor, let's say, we might well accept, recognizing that we have obligated ourselves to a return favor sometime in the future
To engage in this sort of arrangement with another is not to be exploited by that person through the rule for reciprocation
Quite the contrary; it is to participate fairly in the "honored network of obligation" that has served us so well, both individually and societally, from the dawn of humanity
However, if the initial favor turns out to be a device, a trick, an artifice designed specifically to stimulate our compliance with a larger return favor, that is a different story
Here our partner is not a benefactor but a profiteer
And it is here that we should respond to his action on precisely those terms
Once we have determined that his initial offer was not a favor but a compliance tactic, we need only react to it accordingly to be free of its  
As long as we perceive and define his action as a compliance device instead of a favor, he no longer has the reciprocation rule as an ally: The rule says that favors are to be met with favors; it does not require that tricks be met with favors
A practical example may make things more concrete
Let's suppose that a woman phoned one day and introduced herself as a member of 40 /   the Home Fire Safety Association in your town
Suppose she then asked if you would be interested in learning about home fire safety, having your house checked for fire hazards, and receiving a home fire extin guisher, all free of charge
Let's suppose further that you were interested in these things and made an evening appointment to have one of the Association's inspectors come over to provide them
When he arrived, he gave you a small hand extinguisher and began examining the possible fire hazards of your home
Afterward, he gave you some interesting, though frightening, information about general fire dangers, along with an assessment of your home's vulnerability
Finally, he suggested that you get a home firewarning system and left
Such a set of events is not implausible
Various cities and towns have nonprofit associations, usually made up of Fire Department personnel working on their own time, that provide free home firesafety inspec tions of this sort
Were these events to occur, you would clearly have been done a favor by the inspector
In accordance with the reciprocation rule, you should stand more ready to provide a return favor if you were to see him in need of aid at some point in the future
An exchange of favors of this kind would be in the best tradition of the reciprocity rule
A similar set of events with, however, a different ending would also be possible — in fact, more likely
Rather than leaving after recommend ing a firealarm system, the inspector would launch into a sales presentation intended to persuade you to buy an expensive, heat triggered alarm system manufactured by the company he represented
Doortodoor home firealarm companies will frequently use this ap proach
Typically, their product, while effective enough, will be over priced
Trusting that you will not be familiar with the retail costs of such a system and that, if you decide to buy one, you will feel obligated to the company that provided you with a free extinguisher and home inspection, these companies will pressure you for an immediate sale
Using this freeinformationandinspection gambit, fireprotection sales organizations have flourished around the country
18 If you were to find yourself in such a situation with the realization that the primary motive of the inspector's visit was to sell you a costly alarm system, your most effective next action would be a simple, private maneuver
It would involve the mental act of redefinition
Merely define whatever you have received from the inspector — extinguisher, safety information, hazard inspection — not as gifts, but as sales devices, and you will be free to decline (or accept) his purchase offer without even a tug from the reciprocity rule: A favor rightly follows a favor — not a piece of sales strategy
And if he subsequently responds to your refusal by proposing that you, at least, give him the names of some friends he might call on, use your mental maneuver on him again
Define his retreat   41 to this smaller request as what (it is hoped after reading this chapter) you recognize it to be — a compliance tactic
Once done, there would be no pressure to offer the names as a return concession, since his reduced request would not be viewed as a real concession
At this point, un hampered by an inappropriately triggered sense of obligation, you may once again be as compliant or noncompliant as you wish
Provided you are so inclined, you might even turn his own weapon of   against him
Recall that the rule for reciprocation entitles a person who has acted in a certain way to a dose of the same thing
If you have determined that the "fire inspector's" gifts were used, not as genuine gifts, but to make a profit from you, then you might want to use them to make a profit of your own
Simply take whatever the in spector is willing to provide — safety information, home extinguish er — thank him politely, and show him out the door
After all, the reci procity rule asserts that if justice is to be done, exploitation attempts should be exploited
READER'S REPORT From a Former TV and Stereo Salesperson "For quite a while, I worked for a major retailer in their Television and Stereo Department
Salespeople in this department are paid on a com mission basis; however, continued employment was, and still is, based on the ability to sell service contracts rather than merchandise
Company policy was that, for every ten sales you made, you had to sell at least four service contracts
Failure to bring your servicecontract sales up to expected levels for two consecutive months resulted in threats, relo cation, or termination
"Once I recognized the importance of meeting my salescontract quota, I devised a plan that used the rejection thenretreat technique, although I didn't know its name at the time: A customer had the oppor tunity to buy from one to three years' worth of servicecontract coverage at the time of the sale
Most of the sales staff attempted just to sell a singleyear policy
That was my intention as well, since a oneyear contract counted just as much toward my quota as a threeyear contract did
Initially, however, when making my sales pitch, I would advocate the longest and most expensive plan, realizing that most people would not be willing to spend that much (about $140)
But this gave me an excellent opportunity later, after being rejected in my sincere attempt to sell the threeyear plan, to retreat to the oneyear extension and its relatively small $34.95 price, which I was thrilled to get
This proved highly effective, as I sold sales contracts to an average of seventy percent of my customers, who seemed very satisfied with the purchase while 42 /   others in my department clustered around forty percent
I never told anyone how I did it until now." Notice how, as is usually the case, use of the rejection thenretreat tactic engages the action of the contrast principle as well
Not only did the $140 initial request make the $34.95 request seem like a retreat, it made that second request seem smaller too
Chapter 3 COMMITMENT AND CONSISTENCY Hobgoblins of the Mind It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end
— Leonardo da Vinci A STUDY DONE BY A PAIR OF CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGISTS UNCOVERED something fascinating about people at the racetrack: Just after placing a bet, they are much more confident of their horse's chances of winning than they are immediately before laying down that bet 
1 Of course, nothing about the horse's chances actually shifts; it's the same horse, on the same track, in the same field; but in the minds of those bettors, its prospects improve significantly once that ticket is purchased
Although a bit puzzling at first glance, the reason for the dramatic change has to do with a common weapon of social  
Like the other weapons of  , this one lies deep within us, directing our actions with quiet power
It is, quite simply, our nearly obsessive desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done
Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commit ment
Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision
Take the bettors in the racetrack experiment
Thirty seconds before putting down their money, they had been tentative and uncertain; thirty seconds after the deed, they were significantly more optimistic and self assured
The act of making a final decision — in this case, of buying a 44 /   ticket — had been the critical factor
Once a stand had been taken, the need for consistency pressured these people to bring what they felt and believed into line with what they had already done
They simply con vinced themselves that they had made the right choice and, no doubt, felt better about it all
Before we see such selfdelusion as unique to racetrack habitues, we should examine the story of my neighbor Sara and her livein boyfriend, Tim
They met at a hospital where he worked as an Xray technician and she as a nutritionist
They dated for a while, even after Tim lost his job, and eventually they moved in together
Things were never perfect for Sara: She wanted Tim to marry her and to stop his heavy drinking; Tim resisted both ideas
After an especially difficult period of conflict, Sara broke off the relationship, and Tim moved out
At the same time, an old boyfriend of Sara's returned to town after years away and called her
They started seeing each other socially and quickly became serious enough to plan a wedding
They had gone so far as to set a date and issue invitations when Tim called
He had repented and wanted to move back in
When Sara told him her marriage plans, he begged her to change her mind; he wanted to be together with her as before
But Sara refused, saying she didn't want to live like that again
Tim even offered to marry her, but she still said she preferred the other boyfriend
Finally, Tim volunteered to quit drinking if she would only relent
Feeling that under those conditions Tim had the edge, Sara decided to break her engagement, cancel the wedding, retract the invitations, and let Tim move back in with her
Within a month, Tim informed Sara that he didn't think he needed to stop his drinking after all; a month later, he had decided that they should "wait and see" before getting married
Two years have since passed; Tim and Sara continue to live together exactly as before
He still drinks, there are still no marriage plans, yet Sara is more devoted to Tim than she ever was
She says that being forced to choose taught her that Tim really is number one in her heart
So, after choosing Tim over her other boyfriend, Sara became happier with him, even though the conditions under which she had made her choice have never been fulfilled
Obviously, horserace bettors are not alone in their willingness to believe in the correctness of a difficult choice, once made
Indeed, we all fool ourselves from time to time in order to keep our thoughts and beliefs consistent with what we have already done or decided
Psychologists have long understood the power of the consistency principle to direct human action
Prominent theorists such as Leon Festinger, Fritz Hieder, and Theodore Newcomb have viewed the desire for consistency as a central motivator of our behavior
But is this tend   45 ency to be consistent really strong enough to compel us to do what we ordinarily would not want to do? There is no question about it
The drive to be (and look) consistent constitutes a highly potent weapon of social  , often causing us to act in ways that are clearly contrary to our own best interests
Take, as proof, what happened when psychologist Thomas Moriarty staged thefts on a New York City beach to see if onlookers would risk personal harm to halt the crime
In the study, a research accomplice would put a beach blanket down five feet from the blanket of a ran domly chosen individual — the experimental subject
After a couple of minutes on the blanket spent relaxing and listening to music from a portable radio, the accomplice would stand up and leave the blanket to stroll down the beach
A few minutes later, a second researcher, pretending to be a thief, would approach, grab the radio, and try to hurry away with it
As you might guess, under normal conditions, subjects were very reluctant to put themselves in harm's way by chal lenging the thief — only four people did so in the twenty times, that the theft was staged
But when the same procedure was tried another twenty times, with a slight twist, the results were drastically different
In these incidents, before taking his stroll, the accomplice would simply ask the subject to please "watch my things," which each of them agreed to do
Now, propelled by the rule for consistency, nineteen of the twenty subjects became virtual vigilantes, running after and stopping the thief, demanding an explanation, and often restraining the thief physically or snatching the radio away
To understand why consistency is so powerful a motive, it is import ant to recognize that in most circumstances consistency is valued and adaptive
Inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable personality trait
The person whose beliefs, words, and deeds don't match maybe seen as indecisive, confused, twofaced, or even mentally ill
On the other side, a high degree of consistency is normally associated with personal and intellectual strength
It is at the heart of logic, ration ality, stability, and honesty
A quote attributed to the great British chemist Michael Faraday suggests the extent to which being consistent is approved — sometimes more than being right
When asked after a lecture if he meant to imply that a hated academic rival was always wrong, Faraday glowered at the questioner and replied, "He's not that consistent." Certainly, then, good personal consistency is highly valued in our culture
And well it should be
It provides us with a reasonable and gainful orientation to the world
Most of the time we will be better off if our approach to things is well laced with consistency
Without it our lives would be difficult, erratic, and disjointed
46 /   But because it is so typically in our best interests to be consistent, we easily fall into the habit of being automatically so, even in situations where it is not the sensible way to be
When it occurs unthinkingly, consistency can be disastrous
Nonetheless, even blind consistency has its attractions
First, like most other forms of automatic responding, it offers a shortcut through the density of modern life
Once we have made up our minds about an issue, stubborn consistency allows us a very appeal ing luxury: We really don't have to think hard about the issue anymore
We don't have to sift through the blizzard of information we encounter every day to identify relevant facts; we don't have to expend the mental energy to weigh the pros and cons; we don't have to make any further tough decisions
Instead, all we have to do when confronted with the issue is to turn on our consistency tape, whirr, and we know just what to believe, say, or do
We need only believe, say, or do whatever is consistent with our earlier decision
The allure of such a luxury is not to be minimized
It allows us a convenient, relatively effortless, and efficient method for dealing with complex daily environments that make severe demands on our mental energies and capacities
It is not hard to understand, then, why automat ic consistency is a difficult reaction to curb
It offers us a way to evade the rigors of continuing thought
And as Sir Joshua Reynolds noted, "There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking." With our consistency tapes operating, then, we can go about our business happily excused from the toil of having to think too much
There is a second, more perverse attraction of mechanical consistency as well
Sometimes it is not the effort of hard, cognitive work that makes us shirk thoughtful activity, but the harsh consequences of that activity
Sometimes it is the cursedly clear and unwelcome set of answers provided by straight thinking that makes us mental slackers
There are certain disturbing things we simply would rather not realize
Because it is a preprogrammed and mindless method of responding, automatic consistency can supply a safe hiding place from those troubling realiz ations
Sealed within the fortress walls of rigid consistency, we can be impervious to the sieges of reason
One night at an introductory lecture given by the transcendental meditation (TM) program, I witnessed a nice illustration of how people will hide inside the walls of consistency to protect themselves from the troublesome consequences of thought
The lecture itself was presided over by two earnest young men and was designed to recruit new   47 members into the program
The program claimed it could teach a unique brand of meditation that would allow us to achieve all manner of desir able things, ranging from simple inner peace to the more spectacular abilities to fly and pass through walls at the program's advanced (and more expensive) stages
I had decided to attend the meeting to observe the kind of compliance tactics used in recruitment lectures of this sort and had brought along an interested friend, a university professor whose areas of specialization were statistics and symbolic logic
As the meeting progressed and the lecturers explained the theory behind TM, I noticed my logician friend becoming increasingly restless
Looking more and more pained and shifting about constantly in his seat, he was finally unable to resist
When the leaders called for questions at the completion of the lecture, he raised his hand and gently but surely demolished the presentation we had just heard
In less than two minutes, he pointed out precisely where and why the lecturers' complex argument was contradictory, il logical, and unsupportable
The effect on the discussion leaders was devastating
After a confused silence, each attempted a weak reply only to halt midway to confer with his partner and finally to admit that my colleague's points were good ones "requiring further study." More interesting to me, though, was the effect upon the rest of the audience
At the end of the question period, the two recruiters were faced with a crush of audience members submitting their seventyfive dollar down payments for admission to the TM program
Nudging, shrugging, and chuckling to one another as they took in the payments, the recruiters betrayed signs of giddy bewilderment
After what ap peared to have been an embarrassingly clear collapse of their presenta tion, the meeting had somehow turned into a great success, generating mystifyingly high levels of compliance from the audience
Although more than a bit puzzled, I chalked up the audience response to a failure to understand the logic of my colleague's arguments
As it turned out, however, just the reverse was the case
Outside the lecture room after the meeting, we were approached by three members of the audience, each of whom had given a down pay ment immediately after the lecture
They wanted to know why we had come to the session
We explained, and we asked the same question of them
One was an aspiring actor who wanted desperately to succeed at his craft and had come to the meeting to learn if TM would allow him to achieve the necessary selfcontrol to master the art; the recruiters had assured him that it would
The second described herself as a severe insomniac who had hopes that TM would provide her with a way to relax and fall asleep easily at night
The third served as unofficial spokesman
He also had a sleeprelated problem
He was failing college 48 /   because there didn't seem to be enough time to study
He had come to the meeting to find out if TM could help by training him to need fewer hours of sleep each night; the additional time could then be used for study
It is interesting to note that the recruiters informed him as well as the insomniac that Transcendental Meditation techniques could solve their respective, though opposite, problems
Still thinking that the three must have signed up because they hadn't understood the points made by my logician friend, I began to question them about aspects of his argument
To my surprise, I found that they had understood his comments quite well; in fact, all too well
It was precisely the cogency of his argument that drove them to sign up for the program on the spot
The spokesman put it best: "Well, I wasn't going to put down any money tonight because I'm really quite broke right now; I was going to wait until the next meeting
But when your buddy started talking, I knew I'd better give them my money now, or I'd go home and start thinking about what he said and never sign up." All at once, things began to make sense
These were people with real problems; and they were somewhat desperately searching for a way to solve those problems
They were seekers who, if our discussion leaders were to be believed, had found a potential solution in TM
Driven by their needs, they very much wanted to believe that TM was their answer
Now, in the form of my colleague, intrudes the voice of reason, showing the theory underlying their newfound solution to be unsound
Panic! Something must be done at once before logic takes its toll and leaves them without hope again
Quickly, quickly, walls against reason are needed; and it doesn't matter that the fortress to be erected is a foolish one
"Quick, a hiding place from thought! Here, take this money
Whew, safe in the nick of time
No need to think about the issues any longer
The decision has been made, and from now on the consistency tape can be played whenever necessary: 'TM? Certainly I think it will help me; certainly I expect to continue; certainly I believe in TM
I already put my money down for it, didn't I?' Ah, the comforts of mindless consistency
I'll just rest right here for a while
It's so much nicer than the worry and strain of that hard, hard search." If, as it appears, automatic consistency functions as a shield against thought, it should not be surprising that such consistency can also be exploited by those who would prefer that we not think too much in response to their requests for our compliance
For the exploiters, whose interest will be served by an unthinking, mechanical reaction to their requests, our tendency for automatic consistency is a gold mine
So clever are they at arranging to have us play our consistency tapes when it profits them that we seldom realize we have been taken
In fine jujitsu   49 fashion, they structure their interactions with us so that our own need to be consistent will lead directly to their benefit
Certain large toy manufacturers use just such an approach to reduce a problem caused by seasonal buying patterns
Of course, the boom time for toy sales occurs before and during the Christmas holiday sea son
The toy companies make fat profits during this period
Their problem is that toy sales then go into a terrible slump for the next couple of months
Their customers have already spent the full amount in their toy budgets and are stiffly resistant to their children's pleas for more
Even those children whose birthdays fall soon after the holidays receive fewer toys because of the recent Christmas spree
So the toy manufacturers are faced with a dilemma: how to keep sales high during the peak season and, at the same time, retain a healthy demand for toys in the immediately following months
Their difficulty certainly doesn't lie in convincing our naturally insatiable offspring to want a continuous flow of new amusements
A series of flashy television commercials placed among the Saturday morning cartoon shows will produce the usual amounts of begging, whining, and wheedling no matter when it appears during the year
No, the problem is not in mo tivating kids to want more toys after Christmas
The problem is in motivating postholiday spentout parents to reach down for the price of yet another plaything for their already toyglutted children
What could the toy companies possibly do to produce that unlikely behavior? Some have tried a greatly increased advertising campaign, others have reduced prices during the slack period, but neither of those standard sales devices has proved successful
Not only are both tactics costly, but both have also been ineffective in increasing sales to desired levels
Parents are simply not in a toybuying mood, and the  s of advertising or reduced expense are not enough to shake that stony resistance
Certain large toy manufacturers, however, think they have found a solution
It's an ingenious one, involving no more than a normal advert ising expense and an understanding of the powerful pull of the need for consistency
My first hint of how the toy companies' strategy worked came after I fell for it and then, in true patsy form, fell for it again
It was January, and I was in the town's largest toy store
After pur chasing all too many gifts there for my son a month before, I had sworn not to enter that place or any like it for a long, long time
Yet there I was, not only in the diabolic place but also in the process of buying my son another expensive toy — a big, electric roadrace set
In front of the roadrace display, I happened to meet a former neighbor who was buying his son the same toy
The odd thing was that we almost never saw each other anymore
In fact, the last time was a year earlier in that 50 /   same store where we were both buying our sons an expensive post Christmas gift — that time a robot that walked, talked, and laid waste
We laughed about our strange pattern of seeing each other only once a year at the same time, in the same place, while doing the same thing
Later that day, I mentioned the coincidence to a friend who, it turned out, had once worked in the toy business
"No coincidence," he said knowingly
"What do you mean, 'No coincidence'?" "Look," he said, "let me ask you a couple of questions about the road race set you bought this year
First, did you promise your son that he'd get one for Christmas?" "Well, yes, I did
Christopher had seen a bunch of ads for them on the Saturday morning cartoon shows and said that was what he wanted for Christmas
I saw a couple of the ads myself and it looked like fun, so I said okay." "Strike one," he announced
"Now for my second question
When you went to buy one, did you find all the stores sold out?" "That's right, I did! The stores said they'd ordered some but didn't know when they'd get any more in
So I had to buy Christopher some other toys to make up for the roadrace set
But how did you know?" "Strike two," he said
"Just let me ask one more question
Didn't this same sort of thing happen the year before with the robot toy?" "Wait a minute

.you're right
That's just what happened
This is in credible
How did you know?" "No psychic powers; I just happen to know how several of the big toy companies jack up their January and February sales
They start prior to Christmas with attractive TV ads for certain special toys
The kids, naturally, want what they see and extract Christmas promises for these items from their parents
Now here's where the genius of the companies' plan comes in: They undersupply the stores with the toys they've gotten the parents to promise
Most parents find those things sold out and are forced to substitute other toys of equal value
The toy manufacturers, of course, make a point of supplying the stores with plenty of these substitutes
Then, after Christmas, the companies start running the ads again for the other, special toys
That juices up the kids to want those toys more than ever
They go running to their parents whining, 'You promised, you promised,' and the adults go trudging off to the store to live up dutifully to their words." "Where," I said, beginning to seethe now, "they meet other parents they haven't seen for a year, falling for the same trick, right?" "Right
Uh, where are you going?" "I'm going to take that roadrace set right back to the store." I was so angry I was nearly shouting
  51 "Wait
Think for a minute first
Why did you buy it this morning?" "Because I didn't want to let Christopher down and because I wanted to teach him that promises are to be lived up to." "Well, has any of that changed? Look, if you take his toy away now, he won't understand why
He'll just know that his father broke a promise to him
Is that what you want?" "No," I said, sighing, "I guess not
So, you're telling me that they doubled their profit on me for the past two years, and I never even knew it; and now that I do
I'm still trapped — by my own words
So, what you're really telling me is, 'Strike three.'" He nodded, "And you're out." COMMITMENT IS THE KEY Once we realize that the power of consistency is formidable in directing human action, an important practical question immediately arises: How is that force engaged? What produces the click that activates the whirr of the powerful consistency tape? Social psychologists think they know the answer: commitment
If I can get you to make a commitment (that is, to take a stand, to go on record), I will have set the stage for your automatic and illconsidered consistency with that earlier commitment
Once a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with the stand
As we've already seen, social psychologists are not the only ones who understand the connection between commitment and consistency
Commitment strategies are aimed at us by compliance professionals of nearly every sort
Each of the strategies is intended to get us to take some action or make some statement that will trap us into later compli ance through consistency pressures
Procedures designed to create commitment take various forms
Some are fairly straightforward; others are among the most subtle compliance tactics we will encounter
For instance, suppose you wanted to increase the number of people in your area who would agree to go doortodoor collecting donations for your favorite charity
You would be wise to study the approach taken by social psychologist Steven J
Sherman
He simply called a sample of Bloomington, Indiana, residents as part of a survey he was taking and asked them to predict what they would say if asked to spend three hours collecting money for the American Cancer Society
Of course, not wanting to seem uncharitable to the survey taker or to themselves, many of these people said that they would volunteer
The consequence of this sly commitment procedure was a 700 percent in crease in volunteers when, a few days later, a representative of the American Cancer Society did call and ask for neighborhood canvassers
52 /   Using the same strategy, but this time asking Columbus, Ohio, residents to predict whether they would vote on Election Day, a team of research ers led by Anthony Greenwald were able to increase significantly the turnout in a U.S
presidential election among those called
Perhaps an even more crafty commitment technique has been de veloped recently by telephone solicitors for charity
Have you noticed that callers asking you to contribute to some cause or another these days seem to begin things by inquiring about your current health and wellbeing? "Hello Mr
/Ms
Targetperson," they say
"How are you feeling this evening?" Or, "How are you doing today?" The caller's in tent with this sort of introduction is not merely to seem friendly and caring
It is to get you to respond — as you normally do to such polite, superficial inquiries — with a polite, superficial comment of your own: "Just fine" or "Real good" or "I'm doing great, thanks." Once you have publicly stated that all is well, it becomes much easier for the solicitor to corner you into aiding those for whom all is not well: "I'm glad to hear that, because I'm calling to ask if you'd be willing to make a donation to help out the unfortunate victims of

." The theory behind this tactic is that people who have just asserted that they are doing /feeling fine — even as a routine part of a sociable exchange — will consequently find it awkward to appear stingy in the context of their own admittedly favored circumstances
If all this sounds a bit farfetched, consider the findings of consumer researcher Daniel Howard, who put the theory to test
Dallas, Texas, residents were called on the phone and asked if they would agree to allow a representative of the Hunger Relief Committee to come to their homes to sell them cookies, the proceeds from which would be used to supply meals for the needy
When tried alone, that request (labeled the "standard solicit ation approach") produced only 18 percent agreement
However, if the caller initially asked, "How are you feeling this evening?" and waited for a reply before proceeding to the standard approach, several note worthy things happened
First, of the 120 individuals called, most (108) gave the customary favorable reply ("Good," "Fine," "Real well," etc.)
Second, 32 percent of the people who got the "How are you feeling to night" question agreed to receive the cookie seller at their homes, nearly twice the success rate of the standard solicitation approach
Third, true to the consistency principle, almost everyone who agreed to such a visit did, in fact, make a cookie purchase when contacted at home (89 percent)
To make sure that this tactic doesn't generate its successes simply because a solicitor who uses it seems more concerned and courteous than one who doesn't use it, Howard conducted another study
This time callers began either with the question "How are you feeling this   53 evening?" (and waited for a response before proceeding) or with the statement "I hope you are feeling well this evening" and then proceeded to the standard solicitation approach
Despite the fact that the caller started each type of interaction with a warm and friendly comment, the "How are you feeling" technique was, by far, superior to its rival (33 percent vs
15 percent compliance), because it alone drew an exploit able public commitment from its targets
Note that the commitment was able to get twice as much compliance from those targets even though at the time it occurred it must have seemed to them an altogether inconsequential reply to an altogether superficial question — yet another fine example of social jujitsu at work
The question of what makes a commitment effective has a number of answers
A variety of factors affect the ability of a commitment to constrain our future behavior
One largescale program designed to produce compliance illustrates nicely how several of the factors work
The remarkable thing about this program is that it was systematically employing these factors decades ago, well before scientific research had identified them
During the Korean War, many captured American soldiers found themselves in prisonerofwar (POW) camps run by the Chinese Com munists
It became clear early in the conflict that the Chinese treated captives quite differently than did their allies, the North Koreans, who favored savagery and harsh punishment to gain compliance
Specifically avoiding the appearance of brutality, the Red Chinese engaged in what they termed their "lenient policy," which was in reality a concerted and sophisticated psychological assault on their captives
After the war, American psychologists questioned the returning prisoners intensively to determine what had occurred
The intensive psychological investig ation took place, in part, because of the unsettling success of some as pects of the Chinese program
For example, the Chinese were very ef fective in getting Americans to inform on one another, in striking con trast to the behavior of American POWs in World War II
For this reason, among others, escape plans were quickly uncovered and the escape attempts themselves almost always unsuccessful
"When an es cape did occur," wrote Dr
Edgar Schein, a principal American invest igator of the Chinese indoctrination program in Korea, "the Chinese usually recovered the man easily by offering a bag of rice to anyone turning him in." In fact, nearly all American prisoners in the Chinese camps are said to have collaborated with the enemy in one form or an other/ An examination of the Chinese prisoncamp program shows that its personnel relied heavily on commitment and consistency pressures to 54 /   gain the desired compliance from prisoners
Of course, the first problem facing the Chinese was how to get any collaboration at all from the Americans
These were men who were trained to provide nothing but name, rank, and serial number
Short of physical brutalization, how could the captors hope to get such men to give military information, turn in fellow prisoners, or publicly denounce their country? The Chinese answer was elementary: Start small and build
For instance, prisoners were frequently asked to make statements so mildly antiAmerican or proCommunist as to seem inconsequential ("The United States is not perfect." "In a Communist country, unem ployment is not a problem.")
But once these minor requests were complied with, the men found themselves pushed to submit to related yet more substantive requests
A man who had just agreed with his Chinese interrogator that the United States is not perfect might then be asked to indicate some of the ways in which he thought this was the case
Once he had so explained himself, he might be asked to make a list of these "problems with America" and to sign his name to it
Later he might be asked to read his list in a discussion group with other prisoners
"After all, it's what you really believe, isn't it?" Still later he might be asked to write an essay expanding on his list and discussing these problems in greater detail
The Chinese might then use his name and his essay in an anti American radio broadcast beamed not only to the entire camp, but to other POW camps in North Korea, as well as to American forces in South Korea
Suddenly he would find himself a "collaborator," having given aid to the enemy
Aware that he had written the essay without any strong threats or coercion, many times a man would change his image of himself to be consistent with the deed and with the new "col laborator" label, often resulting in even more extensive acts of collabor ation
Thus, while "only a few men were able to avoid collaboration altogether," according to Dr
Schein, "the majority collaborated at one time or another by doing things which seemed to them trivial but which the Chinese were able to turn to their own advantage



This was par ticularly effective in eliciting confessions, selfcriticism, and information during interrogation." 3 If the Chinese know about the subtle power of this approach, it should not be surprising that another group of people interested in compliance is also aware of its usefulness
Many business organizations employ it regularly
For the salesperson, the strategy is to obtain a large purchase by starting with a small one
Almost any small sale will do, because the purpose of that small transaction is not profit
It is commitment
Further   55 purchases, even much larger ones, are expected to flow naturally from the commitment
An article in the trade magazine American Salesman put it succinctly: The general idea is to pave the way for fullline distribution by starting with a small order



Look at it this way — when a person has signed an order for your merchandise, even though the profit is so small it hardly compensates for the time and effort of making the call, he is no longer a prospect — he is a customer
The tactic of starting with a little request in order to gain eventual compliance with related larger requests has a name: the footinthe door technique
Social scientists first became aware of its effectiveness in the mid1960s when psychologists Jonathan Freedman and Scott Fraser published an astonishing set of data
5 They reported the results of an experiment in which a researcher, posing as a volunteer worker, had gone door to door in a residential California neighborhood making a preposterous request of homeowners
The homeowners were asked to allow a publicservice billboard to be installed on their front lawns
To get an idea of just how the sign would look, they were shown a photograph depicting an attractive house, the view of which was almost completely obscured by a very large, poorly lettered sign reading DRIVE CAREFULLY
Although the request was normally and understandably refused by the great majority (83 percent) of the other residents in the area, this particular group of people reacted quite favorably
A full 76 percent of them offered the use of their front yards
The prime reason for their startling compliance has to do with something that had happened to them about two weeks earlier: They had made a small commitment to driver safety
A different volunteer worker had come to their doors and asked them to accept and display a little threeinchsquare sign that read BE A SAFE DRIVER
It was such a trifling request that nearly all of them had agreed to it
But the effects of that request were enormous
Because they had innocently complied with a trivial safedriving request a couple of weeks before, these homeowners became remarkably willing to comply with another such request that was massive in size
Freedman and Fraser didn't stop there
They tried a slightly different procedure on another sample of homeowners
These people first re ceived a request to sign a petition that favored "keeping California beautiful." Of course, nearly everyone signed, since state beauty, like efficiency in government or sound prenatal care, is one of those issues almost no one is against
After waiting about two weeks, Freedman and Fraser sent a new "volunteer worker" to these same homes to ask the residents to allow the big DRIVE CAREFULLY sign to be erected on 56 /   their lawns
In some ways, their response was the most astounding of any of the homeowners in the study
Approximately half of these people consented to the installation of the DRIVE CAREFULLY billboard, even though the small commitment they had made weeks earlier was not to driver safety but to an entirely different publicservice topic, state beautification
At first, even Freedman and Fraser were bewildered by their findings
Why should the little act of signing a petition supporting state beauti fication cause people to be so willing to perform a different and much larger favor? After considering and discarding other explanations, Freedman and Fraser came upon one that offered a solution to the puzzle: Signing the beautification petition changed the view these people had of themselves
They saw themselves as publicspirited citizens who acted on their civic principles
When, two weeks later, they were asked to perform another public service by displaying the DRIVE CAREFULLY sign, they complied in order to be consistent with their newly formed selfimages
According to Freedman and Fraser, What may occur is a change in the person's feelings about getting involved or taking action
Once he has agreed to a request, his at titude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made by strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, who co operates with good causes
6 What the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us, then, is to be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests
Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger requests, it can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only remotely connected to the little one we did earlier
It's this second, general kind of   concealed within small commitments that scares me
It scares me enough that I am rarely willing to sign a petition any more, even for a position I support
Such an action has the potential to   not only my future behavior but also my selfimage in ways I may not want
And once a person's selfimage is altered, all sorts of subtle advantages become available to someone who wants to exploit that new image
Who among Freedman and Fraser's homeowners would have thought that the "volunteer worker" who asked them to sign a state beautifica tion petition was really interested in having them display a safedriving billboard two weeks later? And who among them could have suspected that their decision to display the billboard was largely due to the act of signing the petition? No one, I'd guess
If there were any regrets after   57 the billboard went up, who could they conceivably hold responsible but themselves and their own damnably strong civic spirit? They probably never even considered the guy with the "keeping California beautiful" petition and all that knowledge of jujitsu
Notice that all of the footinthedoor experts seem to be excited about the same thing: You can use small commitments to manipulate a per son's selfimage; you can use them to turn citizens into "public ser vants," prospects into "customers," prisoners into "collaborators." And once you've got a man's selfimage where you want it, he should comply naturally with a whole range of your requests that are consistent with this view of himself
Not all commitments affect selfimage, however
There are certain conditions that should be present for a commitment to be effective in this way
To discover what they are, we can once again look to the American experience in the Chinese prison camps of Korea
It is import ant to understand that the major intent of the Chinese was not simply to extract information from their prisoners
It was to indoctrinate them, to change their attitudes and perceptions of themselves, of their polit ical system, of their country's role in the war, and of communism
And there is evidence that the program often worked alarmingly well
Dr
Henry Segal, chief of the neuropsychiatric evaluation team that examined returning POWs at the war's end, reported that warrelated beliefs had been substantially shifted
The majority of the men believed the Chinese story that the United States had used germ warfare, and many felt that their own forces had been the initial aggressors in starting the war
Similar inroads had been made in the political attitudes of the men: Many expressed antipathy toward the Chinese Communists but at the same time praised them for "the fine job they have done in China." Others stated that "although communism won't work in America, I think it's a good thing for Asia." 7 It appears that the real goal of the Chinese was to modify, at least for a time, the hearts and minds of their captives
If we measure their achievement in terms of "defection, disloyalty, changed attitudes and beliefs, poor discipline, poor morale, poor esprit, and doubts as to America's role," Dr
Segal concluded that "their efforts were highly successful." Because commitment tactics were so much a part of the effective Chinese assault on hearts and minds, it is quite informative to examine the specific features of the tactics they used
58 /   The Magic Act Our best evidence of what people truly feel and believe comes less from their words than from their deeds
Observers trying to decide what a man is like look closely at his actions
What the Chinese have discovered is that the man himself uses this same evidence to decide what he is like
His behavior tells him about himself; it is a primary source of in formation about his beliefs and values and attitudes
Understanding fully this important principle of selfperception, the Chinese set about arranging the prisoncamp experience so that their captives would consistently act in desired ways
Before long, the Chinese knew, these actions would begin to take their toll, causing the men to change their views of themselves to align with what they had done
Writing was one sort of confirming action that the Chinese urged incessantly upon the men
It was never enough for the prisoners to listen quietly or even to agree verbally with the Chinese line; they were always pushed to write it down as well
So intent were the Chinese on securing a written statement that if a prisoner was not willing to write a desired response freely, he was prevailed upon to copy it
The American psychologist Edgar Schein describes a standard indoctrination session tactic of the Chinese in these terms: A further technique was to have the man write out the question and then the [proCommunist] answer
If he refused to write it voluntarily, he was asked to copy it from the notebooks, which must have seemed like a harmless enough concession
But, oh, those "harmless" concessions
We've already seen how ap parently trifling commitments can lead to extraordinary further beha vior
And the Chinese knew that, as a commitment device, a written declaration has some great advantages
First, it provides physical evidence that the act occurred
Once a man wrote what the Chinese wanted, it was very difficult for him to believe that he had not done so
The opportunities to forget or to deny to himself what he had done were not available, as they are for purely verbal statements
No; there it was in his own handwriting, an irrevocably documented act driving him to make his beliefs and his selfimage consistent with what he had undeniably done
A second advantage of a written testament is that it can be shown to other people
Of course, that means it can be used to persuade those people
It can persuade them to change their own attitudes in the direc tion of the statement
But more important for the purpose of commit ment, it can persuade them that the author genuinely believes what   59 was written
People have a natural tendency to think that a statement reflects the true attitude of the person who made it
What is surprising is that they continue to think so even when they know that the person did not freely choose to make the statement
Some scientific evidence that this is the case comes from a study by psychologists Edward Jones and James Harris, who showed people an essay that was favorable to Fidel Castro and asked them to guess the true feelings of its author
Jones and Harris told some of these people that the author had chosen to write a proCastro essay; and they told the other people that the author had been required to write in favor of Castro
The strange thing was that even those people who knew that the author had been assigned to do a proCastro essay guessed that he liked Castro
It seems that a statement of belief produces a click, whirr response in those who view it
Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, observers automatically assume that someone who makes such a statement means it
Think of the doublebarreled effects on the selfimage of a prisoner who wrote a proChinese or antiAmerican statement
Not only was it a lasting personal reminder of his action, it was also likely to persuade those around him that the statement reflected his actual beliefs
And, as we will see in Chapter 4, what those around us think is true of us is enormously important in determining what we ourselves think is true
For example, one study found that after hearing that they were con sidered charitable people
New Haven, Connecticut, housewives gave much more money to a canvasser from the Multiple Sclerosis Associ ation
9 Apparently the mere knowledge that someone viewed them as charitable caused these women to make their actions consistent with another's perception of them
Once an active commitment is made, then, selfimage is squeezed from both sides by consistency pressures
From the inside, there is a pressure to bring selfimage into line with action
From the outside, there is a sneakier pressure — a tendency to adjust this image according to the way others perceive us
And because others see us as believing what we have written (even when we've had little choice in the matter), we will once again experience a pull to bring selfimage into line with the written statement
In Korea, several subtle devices were used to get the prisoners to write, without direct coercion, what the Chinese wanted
For example, the Chinese knew that many prisoners were eager to let their families know that they were alive
At the same time, the men knew that their captors were censoring the mails and that only some letters were being allowed out of camp
To ensure that their own letters would be released, some prisoners began including in their messages peace appeals, claims 60 /   of kind treatment, and statements sympathetic to communism
The hope was that the Chinese would want such letters to surface and would, therefore, allow their delivery
Of course, the Chinese were happy to cooperate because those letters served their interests mar velously
First, their worldwide propaganda effort benefited greatly from the appearance of proCommunist statements by American ser vicemen
Second, in the service of prisoner indoctrination, they had, without raising a finger of physical force, gotten many men to go on record as supporting the Chinese cause
A similar technique involved political essay contests that were regu larly held in camp
The prizes for winning were invariably small — a few cigarettes or a bit of fruit — but were sufficiently scarce that they generated a lot of interest from the men
Usually the winning essay was one that took a solidly proCommunist stand..
but not always
The Chinese were wise enough to realize that most of the prisoners would not enter a contest that they could win only by writing a Communist tract
And the Chinese were clever enough to know how to plant small commitments to communism in the men that could be nurtured into later bloom
So the prize was occasionally given to an essay that gener ally supported the United States but that bowed once or twice to the Chinese view
The effects of this strategy were exactly what the Chinese wanted
The men continued to participate voluntarily in the contests because they saw that they could win with an essay highly favorable to their own country
But perhaps without realizing it, they began to shade their essays a bit toward communism in order to have a better chance of winning
The Chinese were ready to pounce on any concession to Communist dogma and to bring consistency pressures to bear upon it
In the case of a written declaration within a voluntary essay, they had a perfect commitment from which to build toward collaboration and conversion
Other compliance professionals also know about the committing power of written statements
The enormously successful Amway Cor poration, for instance, has hit upon a way to spur their sales personnel to greater and greater accomplishments
Members of the staff are asked to set individual sales goals and commit themselves to those goals by personally recording them on paper: One final tip before you get started: Set a goal and write it down
Whatever the goal, the important thing is that you set it, so you've got something for which to aim — and that you write it down
There is something magical about writing things down
So set a goal and   61 write it down
When you reach that goal, set another and write that down
You'll be off and running
If the Amway people have found "something magical about writing things down," so have other business organizations
Some doortodoor sales companies use the magic of written commitments to battle the "coolingoff" laws recently passed in many states
The laws are designed to allow customers a few days after purchasing an item to cancel the sale and receive a full refund
At first this legislation hurt the hardsell companies deeply
Because they emphasize highpressure tactics, their customers often buy, not because they want the product but because they are duped or intimidated into the sale
When the new laws went into effect, these customers began canceling in droves
The companies have since learned a beautifully simple trick that cuts the number of such cancellations drastically
They merely have the customer, rather than the salesman, fill out the sales agreement
Accord ing to the salestraining program of a prominent encyclopedia company, that personal commitment alone has proved to be "a very important psychological aid in preventing customers from backing out of their contracts." Like the Amway Corporation, then, these organizations have found that something special happens when people personally put their commitments on paper: They live up to what they have written down
Another common way for businesses to cash in on the "magic" of written declarations occurs through the use of an innocentlooking promotional device
Before I began to study weapons of social  , I used to wonder why big companies such as Procter & Gamble and General Foods are always running those "25, 50, or 100 words or less" testimonial contests
They all seem to be alike
The contestant is to compose a short personal statement that begins with the words, "Why I like

." and goes on to laud the features of whatever cake mix or floor wax happens to be at issue
The company judges the entries and awards some stunningly large prizes to the winners
What had puzzled me was what the companies got out of the deal
Often the contest requires no purchase; anyone submitting an entry is eligible
Yet, the companies appear to be strangely willing to incur the huge costs of contest after contest
I am no longer puzzled
The purpose behind the testimonial contests is the same as the purpose behind the political essay contests of the Chinese Communists
In both instances, the aim is to get as many people as possible to go on record as liking the product
In Korea, the product was a brand of Chinese communism; in the United States, it might be a brand of cuticle remover
The type of product doesn't matter; the 62 /   process is the same
Participants voluntarily write essays for attractive prizes that they have only a small chance to win
But they know that for an essay to have any chance of winning at all, it must include praise for the product
So they find praiseworthy features of the product and describe them in their essays
The result is hundreds of men in Korea or hundreds of thousands of people in America who testify in writing to the product's appeal and who, consequently, experience that "magic al" pull to believe what they have written
The Public Eye One reason that written testaments are effective in bringing about genuine personal change is that they can so easily be made public
The prisoner experience in Korea showed the Chinese to be quite aware of an important psychological principle: Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments
The Chinese constantly arranged to have the pro Communist statements of their captives seen by others
A man who had written a political essay the Chinese liked, for example, might find copies of it posted around camp, or might be asked to read it to a pris oner discussion group, or even to read it on the camp radio broadcast
As far as the Chinese were concerned, the more public the better
Why? Whenever one takes a stand that is visible to others, there arises a drive to maintain that stand in order to look like a consistent person
Remember that earlier in this chapter we described how desirable good personal consistency is as a trait; how someone without it could be judged as fickle, uncertain, pliant, scatterbrained, or unstable; how someone with it is viewed as rational, assured, trustworthy, and sound
Given this context, it is hardly surprising that people try to avoid the look of inconsistency
For appearances' sake, then, the more public a stand, the more reluctant we will be to change it
An illustration of how public commitments can lead to doggedly consistent further action is provided in a famous experiment performed by a pair of prominent social psychologists, Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard
The basic procedure was to have college students first estimate in their own minds the length of lines they were shown
At this point, one sample of the students had to commit themselves publicly to their initial judgments by writing them down, signing their names to them, and turning them in to the experimenter
A second sample of students also committed themselves to their first estimates, but they did so privately by putting them on a Magic Writing Pad and then erasing them by lifting the Magic Pad's plastic cover before anyone could see what they had written
A third set of students did not commit them   63 selves to their initial estimates at all; they just kept the estimates in mind privately
In these ways, Deutsch and Gerard had cleverly arranged for some students to commit themselves publicly, some privately, and some not at all to their initial decisions
What Deutsch and Gerard wanted to find out was which of the three types of students would be most inclined to stick with their first judgments after receiving information that those judgments were incorrect
So all of the students were given new evid ence suggesting that their initial estimates were wrong, and they were then given the chance to change their estimates
The results were quite clear
The students who had never written down their first choices were the least loyal to those choices
When new evidence was presented that questioned the wisdom of decisions that had never left their heads, these students were the most  d by the new information to change what they had viewed as the "correct" decision
Compared to these uncommitted students, those who had merely written their decisions for a moment on a Magic Pad were sig nificantly less willing to change their minds when given the chance
Even though they had committed themselves under the most anonym ous of circumstances, the act of writing down their first judgments caused them to resist the   of contradictory new data and to remain consistent with the preliminary choices
But Deutsch and Gerard found that, by far, it was the students who had publicly recorded their initial positions who most resolutely refused to shift from those positions later
Public commitment had hardened them into the most stubborn of all
This sort of stubbornness can occur even in situations where accuracy should be more important than consistency
In one study, when six or twelveperson experimental juries were deciding a close case, hung juries were significantly more frequent if the jurors had to express their opinions with a visible show of hands rather than by secret ballot
Once jurors had stated their initial views publicly, they were reluctant to allow themselves to change publicly, either
Should you ever find yourself as the foreperson of a jury under these conditions, then, you could reduce the risk of a hung jury by choosing a secret rather than public balloting technique
11 The Deutsch and Gerard finding that we are truest to our decisions if we have bound ourselves to them publicly can be put to good use
Consider the organizations dedicated to helping people rid themselves of bad habits
Many weightreduction clinics, for instance, understand that often a person's private decision to lose weight will be too weak to withstand the blandishments of bakery windows, wafting cooking scents, and latenight Sara Lee commercials
So they see to it that the 64 /   decision is buttressed by the pillars of public commitment
They require their clients to write down an immediate weightloss goal and show that goal to as many friends, relatives, and neighbors as possible
Clinic operators report that frequently this simple technique works where all else has failed
Of course, there's no need to pay a special clinic in order to engage a visible commitment as an ally
One San Diego woman described to me how she employed a public promise to help herself finally stop smoking: I remember it was after I heard about another scientific study showing that smoking causes cancer
Every time one of those things came out, I used to get determined to quit, but I never could
This time, though, I decided I had to do something
I'm a proud person
It matters to me if other people see me in a bad light
So I thought, "Maybe I can use that pride to help me dump this damn habit." So I made a list of all the people who I really wanted to respect me
Then I went out and got some blank business cards and I wrote on the back of each card, "I promise you that I will never smoke another cigarette." Within a week, I had given or sent a signed card to everybody on the list — my dad, my brother back East, my boss, my best girlfriend, my exhusband, everybody but one — the guy I was dating then
I was just crazy about him, and I really wanted him to value me as a person
Be lieve me, I thought twice about giving him a card because I knew that if I couldn't keep my promise to him I'd die
But one day at the of fice — he worked in the same building as I did — I just walked up to him, handed him the card, and walked away without saying anything
Quitting "cold turkey" was the hardest thing I've ever done
There must have been a thousand times when I thought I had to have a smoke
But whenever that happened
I'd just picture how all of the people on my list, especially this one guy, would think less of me if I couldn't stick to my guns
And that's all it took
I've never taken another puff
You know, the interesting thing is the guy turned out to be a real schmuck
I can't figure out what I saw in him back then
But at the time, without knowing it, he helped me get through the toughest part of the toughest thing I've ever had to do
I don't even like him anymore
Still, I do feel grateful in a way because I think he saved my life
The Effort Extra Yet another reason that written commitments are so effective is that they require more work than verbal ones
And the evidence is clear that   65 the more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to   the attitudes of the person who made it
We can find that evidence quite close to home or as far away as the back regions of the primitive world
For example, there is a tribe in southern Africa, the Thonga, that requires each of its boys to go through an elaborate initi ation ceremony before he can be counted a man of the tribe
As with many other primitive peoples, a Thonga boy endures a great deal before he is admitted to adult membership in the group
Anthropologists Whiting, Kluckhohn, and Anthony have described this threemonth ordeal in brief but vivid terms: When a boy is somewhere between 10 and 16 years of age, he is sent by his parents to "circumcision school," which is held every 4 or 5 years
Here in company with his agemates he undergoes severe hazing by the adult males of the society
The initiation be gins when each boy runs the gauntlet between two rows of men who beat him with clubs
At the end of this experience he is stripped of his clothes and his hair is cut
He is next met by a man covered with lion manes and is seated upon a stone facing this "lion man." Someone then strikes him from behind and when he turns his head to see who has struck him, his foreskin is seized and in two movements cut off by the "lion man." Afterward he is secluded for three months in the "yard of mysteries," where he can be seen only by the initiated
During the course of his initiation, the boy undergoes six major trials: beatings, exposure to cold, thirst, eating of unsavory foods, punishment, and the threat of death
On the slightest pretext, he may be beaten by one of the newly initiated men, who is assigned to the task by the older men of the tribe
He sleeps without cover ing and suffers bitterly from the winter cold
He is forbidden to drink a drop of water during the whole three months
Meals are often made nauseating by the halfdigested grass from the stomach of an antelope, which is poured over his food
If he is caught breaking any important rule governing the ceremony, he is severe ly punished
For example, in one of these punishments, sticks are placed between the fingers of the offender, then a strong man closes his hand around that of the novice, practically crushing his fingers
He is frightened into submission by being told that in former times boys who had tried to escape or who had revealed the secrets to women or to the uninitiated were hanged and their bodies burned to ashes
1 On the face of it, these rites seem extraordinary and bizarre
Yet, at the same time, they can be seen to be remarkably similar in principle 66 /   and even in detail to the common initiation ceremonies of school fra ternities
During the traditional "Hell Week" held yearly on college campuses, fraternity pledges must persevere through a variety of activities designed by the older members to test the limits of physical exertion, psychological strain, and social embarrassment
At week's end, the boys who have persisted through the ordeal are accepted for full group membership
Mostly their tribulations have left them no more than greatly bred and a bit shaky, although sometimes the negative effects are more serious
What is interesting is how closely the particular features of Hell Week tasks match those of the tribal initiation rites
Recall that anthropologists identified six major trials to be endured by a Thonga initiate during his stay in the "yard of mysteries." A scan of newspaper reports shows that each trial also has its place in the hazing rituals of Greekletter so cieties: • Beatings
Fourteenyearold Michael Kalogris spent three weeks in a Long Island hospital recovering from internal injuries suffered during a Hell Night initiation ceremony of his highschool fraternity
Omega Gamma Delta
He had been administered the "atomic bomb" by his prospective brothers, who told him to hold his hands over his head and keep them there while they gathered around to slam fists into his stomach and back simultaneously and repeatedly
• Exposure to cold
On a winter night, Frederick Bronner, a California juniorcollege student, was taken three thousand feet up and ten miles into the hills of a national forest by his prospective fraternity brothers
Left to find his way home wearing only a thin sweatshirt and slacks
Fat Freddy, as he was called, shivered in a frigid wind until he tumbled down a steep ravine, fracturing bones and hurting his head
Prevented by his injuries from going on, he huddled there against the cold until he died of exposure
• Thirst
Two Ohio State University freshmen found themselves in the "dungeon" of their prospective fraternity house after breaking the rule requiring all pledges to crawl into the dining area prior to Hell Week meals
Once locked in the house storage closet, they were given only salty foods to eat for nearly two days
Nothing was provided for drinking purposes except a pair of plastic cups in which they could catch their own urine
• Eating of unsavory foods
At Kappa Sigma house on the campus of the University of Southern California, the eyes of eleven pledges bulged when they saw the sickening task before them
Eleven quarterpound slabs of raw liver lay on a tray
Cut thick and soaked in oil, each was to be swallowed whole, one to a boy
Gagging and choking re   67 peatedly, young Richard Swanson failed three times to down his piece
Determined to succeed, he finally got the oilsoaked meat into his throat where it lodged and, despite all efforts to remove it, killed him
• Punishment
In Wisconsin, a pledge who forgot one section of a ritual incantation to be memorized by all initiates was punished for his er ror
He was required to keep his feet under the rear legs of a folding chair while the heaviest of his fraternity brothers sat down and drank a beer
Although the pledge did not cry out during the punishment, a bone in each of his feet was broken
• Threats of death
A pledge of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was taken to a beach area of New Jersey and told to dig his "own grave." Seconds after he complied with orders to lie flat in the finished hole, the sides collapsed, suffocating him before his prospective fraternity brothers could dig him out
There is another striking similarity between the initiation rites of tribal and fraternal societies: They simply will not die
Resisting all attempts to eliminate or suppress them, such hazing practices have been phenom enally resilient
Authorities, in the form of colonial governments or university administrations, have tried threats, social pressures, legal actions, banishments, bribes, and bans to persuade the groups to remove the hazards and humiliations from their initiation ceremonies
None has been successful
Oh, there may be a change while the authority is watching closely
But this is usually more apparent than real, the harsher trials occurring under more secret circumstances until the pressure is off and they can surface again
On some college campuses, officials have tried to eliminate dangerous hazing practices by substituting a "Help Week" of civic service or by taking direct control of the initiation rituals
When such attempts are not slyly circumvented by fraternities, they are met with outright physical resistance
For example, in the aftermath of Richard Swanson's choking death at USC, the university president issued new rules requir ing that all pledging activities be reviewed by school authorities before going into effect and that adult advisers be present during initiation ceremonies
According to one national magazine, "The new 'code' set off a riot so violent that city police and fire detachments were afraid to enter campus." Resigning themselves to the inevitable, other college representatives have given up on the possibility of abolishing the degradations of Hell Week
"If hazing is a universal human activity, and every bit of evidence points to this conclusion, you most likely won't be able to ban it effect ively
Refuse to allow it openly and it will go underground
You can't 68 /   ban sex, you can't prohibit alcohol, and you probably can't eliminate hazing!" 3 What is it about hazing practices that make them so precious to these societies? What could make the groups want to evade, undermine, or contest any effort to ban the degrading and perilous features of their initiation rites? Some have argued that the groups themselves are composed of psychological or social miscreants whose twisted needs demand that others be harmed and humiliated
But the evidence does not support such a view
Studies done on the personality traits of fra ternity members, for instance, show them to be, if anything, slightly healthier than other college students in their psychological adjustment
Similarly, fraternities are known for their willingness to engage in be neficial community projects for the general social good
What they are not willing to do, however, is substitute these projects for their initiation ceremonies
One survey at the University of Washington found that, of the fraternity chapters examined, most had a type of Help Week tradition but that this community service was in addition to Hell Week
In only one case was such service directly related to initiation proced The picture that emerges of the perpetrators of hazing practices is of normal individuals who tend to be psychologically stable and socially concerned but who become aberrantly harsh as a group at only one time — immediately before the admission of new members to the society
The evidence, then, points to the ceremony as the culprit
There must be something about its rigors that is vital to the group
There must be some function to its harshness that the group will fight relentlessly to maintain
What? My own view is that the answer appeared in 1959 in the results of a study little known outside of social psychology
A pair of young re searchers, Elliot Aronson and Judson Mills, decided to test their obser vation that "persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort." The real stroke of inspiration came in their choice of the initiation ceremony as the best place to ex amine this possibility
They found that college women who had to en dure a severely embarrassing initiation ceremony in order to gain access to a sex discussion group convinced themselves that their new group and its discussions were extremely valuable, even though Aronson and Mills had previously rehearsed the other group members to be as "worthless and uninteresting" as possible
Different coeds, who went through a much milder initiation ceremony or went through no initiation at all, were decidedly less positive about the "worthless" new group they had joined
Additional research showed the same results when   69 coeds were required to endure pain rather than embarrassment to get into a group
The more electric shock a woman received as part of the initiation ceremony, the more she later persuaded herself that her new group and its activities were interesting, intelligent, and desirable
1 Now the harassments, the exertions, even the beatings of initiation rituals begin to make sense
The Thonga tribesman watching, with tears in his eyes, his tenyearold son tremble through a night on the cold ground of the "yard of mysteries," the college sophomore punctuating his Hell Night paddling of his fraternity "little brother" with bursts of nervous laughter — these are not acts of sadism
They are acts of group survival
They function, oddly enough, to spur future society members to find the group more attractive and worthwhile
As long as it is the case that people like and believe in what they have struggled to get, these groups will continue to arrange effortful and troublesome initiation rites
The loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase to a great degree the chances of group cohesiveness and survival
Indeed, one study of fiftyfour tribal cultures found that those with the most dramatic and stringent initiation ceremonies were those with the greatest group solidarity
” Given Aronson and Mills's demonstration that the severity of an initiation ceremony significantly heightens the newcomer's commitment to the group, it is hardly surprising that groups will oppose all attempts to eliminate this crucial link to their future strength
Military groups and organizations are by no means exempt from these same processes
The agonies of "boot camp" initiations to the armed services are legendary
The novelist William Styron, a former Marine, catalogs his own experiences in language we could easily apply to the Thongas (or, for that matter, to the Kappas or Betas or Alphas): "the remorseless closeorder drill hour after hour in the burning sun, the mental and physical abuse, the humiliations, the frequent sadism at the hands of drill sergeants, all the claustrophobic and terrifying in sults to the spirit which can make an outpost like Quantico or Parris Island one of the closest things in the free world to a concentration camp." But, in his commentary, Styron does more than recount the misery of this "training nightmare" — he recognizes its intended out come: "There is no exMarine of my acquaintance, regardless of what direction he may have taken spiritually or politically after those callow gungho days, who does not view the training as a crucible out of which he emerged in some way more resilient, simply braver and better for the wear." But why should we believe William Styron, the writer, in such mat ters? After all, for professional storytellers, the line between truth and fiction is often blurred
Indeed, why should we believe him when he alleges that the "infernal" character of his military training was not only 70 /   successful, it was specifically intended, intended to create desired levels of pride and camaraderie among those who endured and survived it? At least one reason to accept his assessment comes from unfictionalized reality — the case of West Point cadet John Edwards, who was expelled from the U.S
Military Academy in 1988 on charges involving the au thorized hazing that all firstyear cadets experience at the hands of upperclassmen to ensure that the newcomers can withstand the rigors of West Point training
It was not that Mr
Edwards, who ranked aca demically near the top of his elevenhundredmember class, had been unable to bear up under the ritual when he was subjected to it
Nor was he expelled because he had been aberrantly cruel in his treatment of the younger cadets
His offense was that he would not expose the newcomers to what he felt was "absurd and dehumanizing" treatment
Once again, then, it appears that, for groups concerned about creating a lasting sense of solidarity and distinction, the hardship of demanding initiation activities provides a valuable advantage that they will not easily surrender — either to aspiring members who are unwilling to take the harshness or to give it out
The Inner Choice Examination of such diverse activities as the indoctrination practices of the Chinese Communists and the initiation rituals of college fratern ities has provided some valuable information about commitment
It appears that commitments are most effective in changing a person's selfimage and future behavior when they are active, public, and effort ful
But there is another property of effective commitment that is more important than the other three combined
To understand what it is, we first need to solve a pair of puzzles in the actions of Communist inter rogators and fraternity brothers
The first puzzle comes from the refusal of fraternity chapters to allow publicservice activities to be part of their initiation ceremonies
Recall that one survey showed that community projects, though frequent, were nearly always separated from the membershipinduction program
But why? If an effortful commitment is what fraternities are after in their initiation rites, surely they could structure enough distasteful and strenuous civic activities for their pledges; there is plenty of exertion and unpleasantness to be had in the world of oldagehome repairs, mentalhealthcenter yard work, and hospital bedpan duty
Besides, communityspirited endeavors of this sort would do much to improve the highly unfavorable public and media image of fraternity Hell Week rites; a survey showed that for every positive newspaper story concern ing Hell Week, there were five negative stories
If only for publicrela   71 tions reasons, then, fraternities should want to incorporate community service efforts into their initiation practices
But they don't
To examine the second puzzle, we need to return to the Chinese prison camps of Korea and the regular political essay contests held for American captives
The Chinese wanted as many Americans as possible to enter these contests so that, in the process, they might write things favorable to the Communist view
If, however, the idea was to attract large numbers of entrants, why were the prizes so small? A few extra cigarettes or a little fresh fruit were often all that a contest winner could expect
In the setting, even these prizes were valuable, but still there were much larger rewards — warm clothing, special mail privileges, increased freedom of movement in camp — that the Chinese could have used to increase the number of essay writers
Yet they specifically chose to employ the smaller rather than the larger, more motivating rewards
Although the settings are quite different, the surveyed fraternities refused to allow civic activities into their initiation ceremonies for the same reason that the Chinese withheld large prizes in favor of less powerful inducements: They wanted the men to own what they had done
No excuses, no ways out were allowed
A man who suffered through an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he did so for charitable purposes
A prisoner who salted his political essay with a few antiAmerican comments could not be permitted to shrug it off as motivated by a big reward
No, the fraternity chapters and Chinese Communists were playing for keeps
It was not enough to wring commitments out of their men; those men had to be made to take inner responsibility for their actions
Given the Chinese Communist government's affinity for the political essay contest as a commitment device, it should come as no surprise that a wave of such contests appeared in the aftermath of the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square, where prodemocracy protesters were gunned down by government soldiers
In Beijing alone, nine staterun newspapers and television stations sponsored essay competitions on the "quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion." Still acting in accord with its longstanding and insightful deemphasis of rewards for public commitments, the Beijing government left the contest prizes unspecified
Social scientists have determined that we accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the ab sence of strong outside pressures
A large reward is one such external pressure
It may get us to perform a certain action, but it won't get us to accept inner responsibility for the act
Consequently, we won't feel committed to it
The same is true of a strong threat; it may motivate immediate compliance, but it is unlikely to produce longterm commit ment
72 /   All this has important implications for rearing children
It suggests that we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in
Such pressures will probably produce temporary compliance with our wishes
However, if we want more than just that, if we want the children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want them to continue to perform the desired behavior when we are not present to apply those outside pres sures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner respons ibility for the actions we want them to take
An experiment by Jonathan Freedman gives us some hints about what to do and what not to do in this regard
Freedman wanted to see if he could prevent second to fourthgrade boys from playing with a fascinating toy, just because he had said that it was wrong to do so some six weeks earlier
Anyone familiar with seventonineyearold boys must realize the enormity of the task
But Freedman had a plan
If he could first get the boys to convince them selves that it was wrong to play with the forbidden toy, perhaps that belief would keep them from playing with it thereafter
The difficult thing was making the boys believe that it was wrong to amuse them selves with the toy — an extremely expensive, batterycontrolled robot
Freedman knew it would be easy enough to have a boy obey tempo rarily
All he had to do was threaten the boy with severe consequences should he be caught playing with the toy
As long as he was nearby to deal out stiff punishment, Freedman figured that few boys would risk operating the robot
He was right
After showing a boy an array of five toys and warning him, "It is wrong to play with the robot
If you play with the robot
I'll be very angry and will have to do something about it," Freedman left the room for a few minutes
During that time, the boy was observed secretly through a oneway mirror
Freedman tried this threat procedure on twentytwo different boys, and twentyone of them never touched the robot while he was gone
So a strong threat was successful while the boys thought they might be caught and punished
But Freedman had already guessed that
He was really interested in the effectiveness of the threat in guiding the boys' behavior later on, when he was no longer around
To find out what would happen then, he sent a young woman back to the boys' school about six weeks after he had been there
She took the boys out of the class one at a time to participate in an experiment
Without ever mentioning any connection with Freedman, she escorted each boy back to the room with the five toys and gave him a drawing test
While she was scoring the test, she told the boy that he was free to play with any toy in the room
Of course, almost all the boys played with a toy
The interesting result was that, of the boys playing with a toy, 77 percent   73 chose to play with the robot that had been forbidden to them earlier
Freedman's severe threat, which had been so successful six weeks before, was almost totally unsuccessful when he was no longer able to back it up with punishment
But Freedman wasn't finished yet
He changed his procedure slightly with a second sample of boys
These boys, too, were initially shown the array of five toys by Freedman and warned not to play with the robot while he was briefly out of the room because "It is wrong to play with the robot." But this time, Freedman provided no strong threat to frighten a boy into obedience
He simply left the room and observed through the oneway mirror to see if his instruction against playing with the forbidden toy was enough
It was
Just as with the other sample, only one of the twentytwo boys touched the robot during the short time Freedman was gone
The real difference between the two samples of boys came six weeks later, when they had a chance to play with the toys while Freedman was no longer around
An astonishing thing happened with the boys who had earlier been given no strong threat against playing with the robot: When given the freedom to play with any toy they wished, most avoided the robot, even though it was by far the most attractive of the five toys available (the others were a cheap plastic submarine, a child's baseball glove without a ball, an unloaded toy rifle, and a toy tractor)
When these boys played with one of the five toys, only 33 percent chose the robot
Something dramatic had happened to both groups of boys
For the first group, it was the severe threat they heard from Freedman to back up his statement that playing with the robot was "wrong." It had been quite effective at first when Freedman could catch them should they violate his rule
Later, though, when he was no longer present to observe the boys' behavior, his threat was impotent and his rule was, con sequently, ignored
It seems clear that the threat had not taught the boys that operating the robot was wrong, only that it was unwise to do so when the possibility of punishment existed
For the other boys, the dramatic event had come from the inside, not the outside
Freedman had instructed them, too, that playing with the robot was wrong, but he had added no threat of punishment should they disobey him
There were two important results
First, Freedman's instruction alone was enough to prevent the boys from operating the robot while he was briefly out of the room
Second, the boys took per sonal responsibility for their choice to stay away from the robot during that time
They decided that they hadn't played with it because they didn't want to
After all, there were no strong punishments associated with the toy to explain their behavior otherwise
Thus, weeks later
74 /   when Freedman was nowhere around, they still ignored the robot be cause they had been changed inside to believe that they did not want to play with it
1 Adults facing the childrearing experience can take a cue from the Freedman study
Suppose a couple wants to impress upon their daughter that lying is wrong
A strong, clear threat ("It's bad to lie, honey; so if I catch you at it
I'll cut your tongue out") might well be effective when the parents are present or when the girl thinks she can be discovered
But it will not achieve the larger goal of convincing her that she does not want to lie because she thinks it's wrong
To do that, a much subtler approach is required
A reason must be given that is just strong enough to get her to be truthful most of the time but is not so strong that she sees it as the obvious reason for her truthfulness
It's a tricky business, because exactly what this barely sufficient reason will be changes from child to child
For one little girl, a simple appeal may be enough ("It's bad to lie, honey; so I hope you won't do it"); for an other child, it may be necessary to add a somewhat stronger reason ("

.because if you do
I'll be disappointed in you"); for a third child, a mild form of warning may be required as well ("...and I'll probably have to do something I don't want to do")
Wise parents will know which kind of reason will work on their own children
The important thing is to use a reason that will initially produce the desired behavior and will, at the same time, allow a child to take personal responsibility for that behavior
Thus, the less detectable outside pressure such a reason contains, the better
Selecting just the right reason is not an easy task for parents
But the effort should pay off
It is likely to mean the difference between shortlived compliance and longterm commitment
For a pair of reasons we have already talked about, compliance pro fessionals love commitments that produce inner change
First, that change is not just specific to the situation where it first occurred; it covers a whole range of related situations, too
Second, the effects of the change are lasting
So, once a man has been induced to take action that shifts his selfimage to that of, let's say, a publicspirited citizen, he is likely to be publicspirited in a variety of other circumstances where his compliance may also be desired, and he is likely to continue his publicspirited behavior for as long as his new selfimage holds
There is yet another attraction in commitments that lead to inner change — they grow their own legs
There is no need for the compliance professional to undertake a costly and continuing effort to reinforce the change; the pressure for consistency will take care of all that
After our friend comes to view himself as a publicspirited citizen, he will auto matically begin to see things differently
He will convince himself that   75 it is the correct way to be
He will begin to pay attention to facts he hadn't noticed before about the value of community service
He will make himself available to hear arguments he hadn't heard before favor ing civic action
And he will find such arguments more persuasive than before
In general, because of the need to be consistent within his system of beliefs, he will assure himself that his choice to take publicspirited action was right
What is important about this process of generating additional reasons to justify the commitment is that the reasons are new
Thus, even if the original reason for the civicminded behavior was taken away, these newly discovered reasons might be enough by themselves to support his perception that he had behaved correctly
The advantage to an unscrupulous compliance professional is tre mendous
Because we build new struts to undergird choices we have committed ourselves to, an exploitative individual can offer us an in ducement for making such a choice, and after the decision has been made, can remove that inducement, knowing that our decision will probably stand on its own newly created legs
Newcar dealers fre quently try to benefit from this process through a trick they call "throwing a lowball." I first encountered the tactic while posing as a sales trainee at a local Chevrolet dealership
After a week of basic in struction, I was allowed to watch the regular salesmen perform
One practice that caught my attention right away was the lowball
For certain customers, a very good price is offered on a car, perhaps as much as four hundred dollars below competitors' prices
The good deal, however, is not genuine; the dealer never intends it to go through
Its only purpose is to cause a prospect to decide to buy one of the deal ership's cars
Once the decision is made, a number of activities develop the customer's sense of personal commitment to the car — a raft of pur chase forms are filled out, extensive financing terms are arranged, sometimes the customer is encouraged to drive the car for a day before signing the contract "so you can get the feel of it and show it around in the neighborhood and at work." During this time, the dealer knows, customers automatically develop a range of new reasons to support the choice they have now made
Then something happens
Occasionally an "error" in the calculations is discovered — maybe the salesman forgot to add in the cost of the air conditioner, and if the buyer still requires air conditioning, four hundred dollars must be added to the price
To keep from being suspected of gouging by the customer, some dealers let the bank handling the finan cing find the mistake
At other times, the deal is disallowed at the last moment when the salesman checks with his boss, who cancels it because "We'd be losing money." For only another four hundred dollars the car can be had, which, in the context of a multithousanddollar deal
76 /   doesn't seem too steep since, as the salesman emphasizes, the cost is equal to competitors' and "This is the car you chose, right?" Another, even more insidious form of lowballing occurs when the salesman makes an inflated tradein offer on the prospect's old car as part of the buy/ trade package
The customer recognizes the offer as overly gener ous and jumps at the deal
Later, before the contract is signed, the used car manager says that the salesman's estimate was four hundred dollars too high and reduces the tradein allowance to its actual, bluebook level
The customer, realizing that the reduced offer is the fair one, ac cepts it as appropriate and sometimes feels guilty about trying to take advantage of the salesman's high estimate
I once witnessed a woman provide an embarrassed apology to a salesman who had used the last version of lowballing on her — this while she was signing a newcar contract giving him a huge commission
He looked hurt but managed a forgiving smile
No matter which variety of lowballing is used, the sequence is the same: An advantage is offered that induces a favorable purchase de cision; then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed
It seems almost incredible that a customer would buy a car under these circumstances
Yet it works — not on everybody, of course, but it is ef fective enough to be a staple compliance procedure in many, many car showrooms
Automobile dealers have come to understand the ability of a personal commitment to build its own support system, a support system of new justifications for the commitment
Often these justifica tions provide so many strong legs for the decision to stand on that when the dealer pulls away only one leg, the original one, there is no collapse
The loss can be shrugged off by the customer who is consoled, even made happy, by the array of other good reasons favoring the choice
It never occurs to the buyer that those additional reasons might never have existed had the choice not been made in the first place
The impressive thing about the lowball tactic is its ability to make a person feel pleased with a poor choice
Those who have only poor choices to offer us, then, are especially fond of the technique
We can find them throwing lowballs in business, social, and personal situations
For instance, there's my neighbor Tim, a true lowball aficionado
Recall that he's the one who, by promising to change his ways, got his girl friend, Sara, to cancel her impending marriage to another and to take him back
Since her decision for Tim, Sara has become more devoted to him than ever, even though he has not fulfilled his promises
She explains this by saying that she has allowed herself to see all sorts of positive qualities in Tim she had never recognized before
  77 I know full well that Sara is a lowball victim
Just as sure as I had watched buyers fall for the giveitandtakeitawaylater strategy in the car showroom, I watched her fall for the same trick with Tim
For his part, Tim remains the guy he has always been
But because the new attractions Sara has discovered (or created) in him are quite real for her, she now seems satisfied with the same arrangement that was unaccept able before her enormous commitment
The decision to choose Tim, poor as it may have been objectively, has grown its own supports and appears to have made Sara genuinely happy
I have never mentioned to Sara what I know about lowballing
The reason for my silence is not that I think her better off in the dark on the issue
As a general guiding principle, more information is always better than less information
It's just that, if I said a word, I am confident she would hate me for it
Depending on the motives of the person wishing to use them, any of the compliance techniques discussed in this book can be employed for good or for ill
It should not be surprising, then, that the lowball tactic can be used for more socially beneficial purposes than selling new cars or reestablishing relationships with former lovers
One research project done in Iowa, for example, shows how the lowball procedure can influ ence homeowners to conserve energy
y The project, headed by Dr
Michael Pallak, began at the start of the Iowa winter when residents who heated their homes with natural gas were contacted by an inter viewer
The interviewer gave them some energyconservation tips and asked them to try to save fuel in the future
Although they all agreed to try, when the researchers examined the utility records of these fam ilies after a month and again at winter's end, it was clear that no real savings had occurred
The residents who had promised to make a conservation attempt used just as much natural gas as a random sample of their neighbors who had not been contacted by an interviewer
Just good intentions coupled with information about saving fuel, then, were not enough to change habits
Even before the project began, Pallak and his research team had re cognized that something more would be needed to shift longstanding energy patterns
So they tried a slightly different procedure on a com parable sample of Iowa naturalgas users
These people, too, were contacted by an interviewer, who provided energysaving hints and asked them to conserve
But for these families, the interviewer offered something else: Those residents agreeing to save energy would have their names publicized in newspaper articles as publicspirited, fuel conserving citizens
The effect was immediate
One month later, when the utility companies checked their meters, the homeowners in this sample had saved an average of 422 cubic feet of natural gas apiece
78 /   The chance to have their names in the paper had motivated these resid ents to substantial conservation efforts for a period of a month
Then the rug was pulled out
The researchers extracted the reason that had initially caused these people to save fuel
Each family that had been promised publicity received a letter saying it would not be possible to publicize their names after all
At the end of the winter, the research team examined the effect that letter had had on the naturalgas usage of the families
Did they return to their old, wasteful habits when the chance to be in the newspaper was removed? Hardly
For each of the remaining winter months, they actually conserved more fuel than they had during the time they thought they would be publicly celebrated for it! In terms of percentage of energy savings, they had managed a 12.2 percent firstmonth gas savings be cause they expected to see themselves lauded in the paper
But after the letter arrived informing them to the contrary, they did not return to their previous energyuse levels; instead, they increased their savings to a 15.5 percent level for the rest of the winter
Although we can never be completely sure of such things, one explan ation for their persistent behavior presents itself immediately
These people had been lowballed into a conservation commitment through a promise of newspaper publicity
Once made, that commitment started generating its own support: The homeowners began acquiring new energy habits, began feeling good about their publicspirited efforts, began convincing themselves of the vital need to reduce American de pendence on foreign fuel, began appreciating the monetary savings in their utility bills, began feeling proud of their capacity for selfdenial, and, most important, began viewing themselves as conservation minded
With all these new reasons present to justify the commitment to use less energy, it is no wonder that the commitment remained firm even after the original reason, newspaper publicity, had been kicked away
But strangely enough, when the publicity factor was no longer a possibility, these families did not merely maintain their fuelsaving ef fort, they heightened it
Any of a number of interpretations could be offered for that still stronger effort, but I have a favorite
In a way, the opportunity to receive newspaper publicity had prevented the homeowners from fully owning their commitment to conservation
Of all the reasons supporting the decision to try to save fuel, it was the only one that had come from the outside; it was the only one preventing the homeowners from thinking that they were conserving gas because they believed in it
So when the letter arrived canceling the publicity agreement, it removed the only impediment to these residents' images of themselves as fully concerned, energyconscious citizens
This un   79 qualified, new selfimage then pushed them to even greater heights of conservation
Whether or not such an explanation is correct, a repeat study done by Pallak indicates that this hidden benefit of the lowball tactic is no fluke
The experiment was done in summer on Iowans whose homes were cooled by central airconditioning
Those homeowners who were promised newspaper publicity decreased their electricity use by 27.8 percent during July, as compared to similar homeowners who were not promised any coverage or who were not contacted at all
At the end of July, a letter was sent canceling the publicity promise
Rather than re verting to their old habits, the lowballed residents increased their August energy savings to a stunning 41.6 percent
Much like Sara, they appeared to have become committed to a choice through an initial inducement and were still more dedicated to it after the inducement had been re moved
HOW TO SAY NO "Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds." Or, at least, so goes a frequently heard quotation attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson
But what a very odd thing to say
Looking around, it is obvious that, quite contrary to what Emerson seems to have suggested, internal consistency is a hallmark of logic and intellectual strength, while its lack character izes the intellectually scattered and limited among us
What, then, could a thinker of Emerson's caliber have meant when he assigned the trait of consistency to the smallminded? I was sufficiently intrigued to go back to the original source of his statement, the essay "SelfReliance," where it was clear that the problem lay not in Emerson, but in the popular version of what he had said
Actually he wrote, "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds." For some obscure reason, a central distinction had been lost as the years eroded the accurate version of his statement to mean something entirely different and, upon close inspection, entirely silly
20 That distinction should not be lost on us, however, because it is vital to the only effective defense I know against the weapons of   embodied in the combined principles of commitment and consistency
Although consistency is generally good, even vital, there is a foolish, rigid variety to be shunned
It is this tendency to be automatically and unthinkingly consistent that Emerson referred to
And it is this tendency that we must be wary of, for it lays us open to the maneuvers of those who want to exploit the mechanical commitment — * consistency se quence for profit
But since automatic consistency is so useful in allowing us an econom 80 /   ical and appropriate way of behaving most of the time, we can't decide merely to eliminate it from our lives altogether
The results would be disastrous
If, rather than whirring along in accordance with our prior decisions and deeds, we stopped to think through the merits of every new action before performing it, we would never have time to accom plish anything significant
We need even that dangerous, mechanical brand of consistency
The only way out of the dilemma is to know when such consistency is likely to lead to a poor choice
There are certain signals — two separate kinds of signals, in fact — to tip us off
We register each type in a different part of our bodies
The first sort of signal is easy to recognize
It occurs right in the pit of our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with a request we know we don't want to perform
It has happened to me a hundred times
An especially memorable instance, though, took place on a summer evening well before I began to study compliance tactics
I answered my doorbell to find a stunning young woman dressed in shorts and a revealing halter top
I noticed, nonetheless, that she was carrying a clipboard and was asking me to participate in a survey
Wanting to make a favorable impression, I agreed and, I do admit, stretched the truth in my interview answers so as to present myself in the most positive light
Our conversation went as follows: STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN: Hello, I'm doing a survey on the entertain ment habits of city residents, and I wonder if you could answer a few questions for me
CIALDINI: Do come in
SYW: Thank you
I'll just sit right here and begin
How many times per week would you say that you go out to dinner? C: Oh, probably three, maybe four times a week
Whenever I can, really; I love fine restaurants
SYW: How nice
And do you usually order wine with your dinner? C: Only if it's imported
SYW: I see
What about movies? Do you go to the movies much? C: The cinema? I can't get enough of good films
I especially like the   81 sophisticated kind with the words on the bottom of the screen
How about you? Do you like to see films? SYW: Uh...yes, I do
But let's get back to the interview
Do you go to many concerts? C: Definitely
The symphonic stuff mostly, of course; but I do enjoy a quality pop group as well
SYW (writing rapidly): Great! Just one more question
What about touring performances by theatrical or ballet companies? Do you see them when they're in town? C: Ah, the ballet — the movement, the grace, the form — I love it
Mark me down as loving the ballet
See it every chance I get
SYW: Fine
Just let me recheck my figures here for a moment, Mr
Cialdini
C: Actually, it's Dr
Cialdini
But that sounds so formal; why don't you call me Bob? SYW: All right
Bob
From the information you've already given me, I'm pleased to say that you could save up to twelve hundred dollars a year by joining Clubamerica! A small membership fee entitles you to dis counts on most of the activities you've mentioned
Surely someone as socially vigorous as yourself would want to take advantage of the tre mendous savings our company can offer on all the things you've already told me you do
C (trapped like a rat): Well...uh...I...uh...I guess so
I remember quite well feeling my stomach tighten as I stammered my agreement
It was a clear call to my brain, "Hey, you're being taken here!" But I couldn't see a way out
I had been cornered by my own words
To decline her offer at that point would have meant facing a pair of distasteful alternatives: If I tried to back out by protesting that I was not actually the manabouttown I had claimed to be during the interview, I would come off a liar; but trying to refuse without that protest would make me come off a fool for not wanting to save twelve hundred dollars
So I bought the entertainment package, even though 82 /   I knew I had been set up so that the need to be consistent with what I had already said would snare me
No more, though
I listen to my stomach these days
And I have dis covered a way to handle people who try to use the consistency principle on me
I just tell them exactly what they are doing
It works beautifully
Most of the time, they don't understand me; they just become sufficiently confused to want to leave me alone
I think they suspect lunacy in anyone who responds to their requests by explaining what Ralph Waldo Emerson meant in distinguishing between consistency and foolish consistency
Usually they have already begun edging away by the time I have mentioned "hobgoblins of the mind" and are gone long before I have described the click, whirr character of commitment and consist ency
Occasionally, though, they realize that I am on to their game
I always know when that happens — it's as clear as the egg on their faces
They invariably become flustered, bumble through a hasty exit line, and go for the door
This tactic has become the perfect counterattack for me
Whenever my stomach tells me I would be a sucker to comply with a request merely because doing so would be consistent with some prior commit ment I was tricked into, I relay that message to the requester
I don't try to deny the importance of consistency; I just point out the absurdity of foolish consistency
Whether, in response, the requester shrinks away guiltily or retreats in bewilderment, I am content
I have won; an ex ploiter has lost
I sometimes think about how it would be if that stunning young woman of years ago were to try to sell me an entertainmentclub membership now
I have it all worked out
The entire interaction would be the same, except for the end: SYW: 

.Surely someone as socially vigorous as yourself would want to take advantage of the tremendous savings our company can offer on all the things you've already told me you do
C (with great selfassurance): Quite wrong
You see, I recognize what has gone on here
I know that your story about doing a survey was just a pretext for getting people to tell you how often they go out and that, under those circumstances, there is a natural tendency to exaggerate
I also realize that your bosses selected you for this job because of your physical attractiveness and told you to wear clothes showing a lot of your resilient body tissue because a pretty, scantily clad woman is likely to get men to brag about what swingers they are in order to impress her
So I'm not interested in your entertainment club because of what Emerson said about foolish consistency and hobgoblins of the mind
  83 SYW (staring blankly): Huh? C: Look
What I told you during your fake survey doesn't matter
I refuse to allow myself to be locked into a mechanical sequence of commitment and consistency when I know it's wrongheaded
No click, whirr for me
SYW: Huh? C: Okay, let me put it this way: (1) It would be stupid of me to spend money on something I don't want
(2) I have it on excellent authority, direct from my stomach, that I don't want your entertainment plan
(3) Therefore, if you still believe that I will buy it, you probably also still believe in the Tooth Fairy
Surely, someone as intelligent as yourself would be able to understand that
SYW ( trapped like a stunning young rat): Well

.1 guess so
Stomachs are not especially perceptive or subtle organs
Only when it is obvious that we are about to be conned are they likely to register and transmit that message
At other times, when it is not clear that we are being taken, our stomachs may never catch on
Under those circum stances we have to look elsewhere for a clue
The situation of my neighbor Sara provides a good illustration
She made an important commitment to Tim by canceling her prior marriage plans
That com mitment has grown its own supports, so that even though the original reasons for the commitment are gone, she remains in harmony with it
She has convinced herself with newly formed reasons that she did the right thing, so she stays with Tim
It is not difficult to see why there would be no tightening in Sara's stomach as a result
Stomachs tell us when we are doing something we think is wrong for us
Sara thinks no such thing
To her mind, she has chosen correctly and is behaving consistently with that choice
Yet, unless I badly miss my guess, there is a part of Sara that recog nizes her choice as a mistake and her current living arrangement as a brand of foolish consistency
Where, exactly, that part of Sara is located we can't be sure
But our language does give it a name: heart of hearts
It is, by definition, the one place where we cannot fool ourselves
It is the place where none of our justifications, none of our rationalizations penetrate
Sara has the truth there, although, right now, she can't hear its signal clearly through the noise and static of the new support appar atus she has erected
If Sara has erred in her choice of Tim, how long could she go without 84 /   clearly recognizing it, without having a massive heart of hearts attack? There is no telling
One thing is certain, however: As time passes, the various alternatives to Tim are disappearing
She had better determine soon whether she is making a mistake
Easier said than done, of course
She must answer an extremely in tricate question: "Knowing what I now know, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice?" The problem lies in the "Knowing what I now know" part of the question
Just what does she now know, accurately, about Tim? How much of what she thinks of him is the result of a desperate attempt to justify the commitment she made? She claims that since her decision to take him back, he cares for her more, is trying hard to stop his excessive drinking, has learned to make a wonderful omelet, etc
Having tasted a couple of his omelets, I have my doubts
The important issue, though, is whether she believes these things, not just intellectually — we can play such mind games on ourselves — but in her heart of hearts
There may be a little device Sara can use to find out how much of her current satisfaction with Tim is real and how much is foolish consist ency
Accumulating psychological evidence indicates that we experience our feelings toward something a split second before we can intellectu alize about it/ 1 My suspicion is that the message sent by the heart of hearts is a pure, basic feeling
Therefore, if we train ourselves to be at tentive, we should register it ever so slightly before our cognitive appar atus engages
According to this approach, were Sara to ask herself the crucial "Would I make the same choice again?" question, she would be well advised to look for and trust the first flash of feeling she experi enced in response
It would likely be the signal from her heart of hearts, slipping through undistorted just before the means by which she could kid herself flooded in/ I have begun using the same device myself whenever I even suspect I might be acting in a foolishly consistent manner
One time, for instance, I had stopped at the selfservice pump of a filling station advertising a price per gallon a couple of cents below the rate of other stations in the area
But with pump nozzle in hand, I noticed that the price listed on the pump was two cents higher than the display sign price
When I mentioned the difference to a passing attendant, who I later learned was the owner, he mumbled uncon vincingly that the rates had changed a few days ago but there hadn't been time to correct the display
I tried to decide what to do
Some reasons for staying came to mind — "I really do need gasoline badly." "This pump is available, and I am in sort of a hurry." "I think I remember that my car runs better on this brand of gas." I needed to determine whether those reasons were genuine or mere   85 justifications for my decision to stop there
So I asked myself the crucial question, "Knowing what I know about the real price of this gasoline, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice again?" Con centrating on the first burst of impression I sensed, the answer was clear and unqualified
I would have driven right past
I wouldn't even have slowed down
I knew then that without the price advantage, those other reasons would not have brought me there
They hadn't created the decision; the decision had created them
That settled, there was another decision to be faced, though
Since I was already there holding the hose, wouldn't it be better to use it than to suffer the inconvenience of going elsewhere to pay the same price? Fortunately, the station attendantowner came over and helped me make up my mind
He asked why I wasn't pumping any gas
I told him I didn't like the price discrepancy, and he said with a snarl, "Listen, nobody's gonna tell me how to run my business
If you think I'm cheating you, just put that hose down right now and get off my property as fast as you can do it, bud." Already certain he was a cheat, I was happy to act consistently with my belief and his wishes
I dropped the hose on the spot..
and drove over it on my way to the closest exit
Sometimes consistency can be a marvelously rewarding thing
READER'S REPORT From a Woman Living in Portland, Oregon "I was walking through downtown Portland on my way to a lunch appointment when a young, attractive man stopped me with a friendly smile and a powerful line: 'Excuse me
I'm involved in a contest and I need a goodlooking woman like yourself to help me win.' I was truly skeptical, since I know there are many more attractive women than myself running around; however, I was caught off guard and was curious to find out what he wanted
He explained that he would receive points for a contest by getting total strangers to give him a kiss
Now I consider myself a fairly levelheaded person who shouldn't have be lieved his line, but he was quite persistent, and since I was almost late for my lunch appointment, I thought, 'What the heck
I'll give the guy a kiss and get out of here.' So I did something totally against my com mon sense and pecked this total stranger on the cheek in the middle of downtown Portland! "I thought that would be the end of it, but I soon learned that it was just the beginning
Much to my distress, he followed the kiss with the line 'You are a great kisser, but the real contest I am involved in is to sell magazine subscriptions
You must be an active person
Would any of these magazines interest you?' At this point I should have slugged 86 /   the guy and walked away; but somehow, because I had complied with his initial request, I felt a need to be consistent, and I complied with his second request
Yes, much to my own disbelief, I actually subscribed to SKI magazine (which I occasionally enjoy reading, but had no inten tion of subscribing to), gave him a fivedollar initialsubscription fee and left as quickly as possible, feeling quite frustrated with what I had just done and not understanding why I had done it
"Although it still pains me to think about it, in reflecting on the incid ent after reading your book
I've now figured out what happened
The reason this tactic worked so effectively is because once small commit ments have been made (in this case, giving a kiss), people tend to add justifications to support the commitment and then are willing to commit themselves further
In this situation, I justified complying with the second request because it was consistent with my initial action
If I had only listened to my 'stomach signs/ I could have saved myself a lot of humiliation." By extracting a kiss, the salesman exploited the consistency principle in two ways
First, by the time he asked for her aid in the magazine contest, his prospect had already gone on record — with that kiss — as agreeing to help him zvin a contest
Second, it seems only natural (i.e., congruent) that if a zvoman feels positively enough tozvard a man to kiss him, she should feel positively tozvard helping him out
Chapter 4 SOCIAL PROOF Truths Are Us Where all think alike, no one thinks very much
— WALTER LIPPMANN T DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO LIKES CANNED LAUGHTER
IN FACT, when I surveyed the people who came into my office one day — several students, two telephone repairmen, a number of university professors, and the janitor — the reaction was invariably critical
Television, with its incessant system of laugh tracks and technically augmented mirth, received the most heat
The people I questioned hated canned laughter
They called it stupid, phony, and obvious
Although my sample was small, I would bet that it closely reflects the negative feelings of most of the American public toward laugh tracks
Why, then, is canned laughter so popular with television executives? They have won their exalted positions and splendid salaries by knowing how to give the public what it wants
Yet they religiously employ the laugh tracks that their audiences find distasteful
And they do so over the objections of many of their most talented artists
It is not uncommon for acclaimed directors, writers, or actors to demand the elimination of canned responses from the television projects they undertake
These demands are only sometimes successful, and when they are, it is not without a battle
What could it be about canned laughter that is so attractive to televi sion executives? Why would these shrewd and tested businessmen champion a practice that their potential watchers find disagreeable and their most creative talents find personally insulting? The answer is at 88 /   once simple and intriguing: They know what the research says
Exper iments have found that the use of canned merriment causes an audience to laugh longer and more often when humorous material is presented and to rate the material as funnier
In addition, some evidence indicates 1 that canned laughter is most effective for poor jokes
In the light of these data, the actions of television executives make perfect sense
The introduction of laugh tracks into their comic program ming will increase the humorous and appreciative responses of an audience, even — and especially — when the material is of poor quality
Is it any surprise, then, that television, glutted as it is with artless situ ationcomedy attempts, should be saturated with canned laughter? Those executives know precisely what they are doing
But with the mystery of the widespread use of laugh tracks solved, we are left with a more perplexing question: Why does canned laughter work on us the way it does? It is no longer the television executives who appear peculiar; they are acting logically and in their own interests
Instead, it is the behavior of the audience, of you and me, that seems strange
Why should we laugh more at comedy material afloat in a sea of mechanically fabricated merriment? And why should we think that comic flotsam funnier? The executives aren't really fooling us
Anyone can recognize dubbed laughter
It is so blatant, so clearly counterfeit, that there could be no confusing it with the real thing
We know full well that the hilarity we hear is irrelevant to the humorous quality of the joke it follows, that it is created not spontaneously by a genuine audience, but artificially by a technician at a control board
Yet, trans parent forgery that it is, it works on us! To discover why canned laughter is so effective, we first need to un derstand the nature of yet another potent weapon of  : the principle of social proof
It states that one means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct
The principle applies especially to the way we decide what constitutes cor rect behavior
We view a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it
Whether the question is what to do with an empty popcorn box in a movie theater, how fast to drive on a certain stretch of highway, or how to eat the chicken at a dinner party, the actions of those around us will be important in defining the answer
The tendency to see an action as more appropriate when others are doing it normally works quite well
As a rule, we will make fewer mistakes by acting in accord with social evidence than contrary to it
Usually, when a lot of people are doing something, it is the right thing to do
This feature of the principle of social proof is simultaneously its   89 major strength and its major weakness
Like the other weapons of influ ence, it provides a convenient shortcut for determining how to behave but, at the same time, makes one who uses the shortcut vulnerable to the attacks of profiteers who lie in wait along its path
In the case of canned laughter, the problem comes when we begin responding to social proof in such a mindless and reflexive fashion that we can be fooled by partial or fake evidence
Our folly is not that we use others' laughter to help decide what is humorous and when mirth is appropriate; that is in keeping with the wellfounded principle of social proof
The folly is that we do so in response to patently fraudulent laughter
Somehow, one disembodied feature of humor — a sound — works like the essence of humor
The example from Chapter 1 of the turkey and the polecat is instructive here
Remember that be cause the particular "cheepcheep" of turkey chicks is normally associ ated with newborn turkeys, their mothers will display or withhold maternal care solely on the basis of that sound? And remember how, consequently, it was possible to trick a female turkey into mothering a stuffed polecat as long as the replica played the recorded "cheepcheep" of a baby turkey? The simulated chick sound was enough to start the female's mothering tape whirring
The lesson of the turkey and the polecat illustrates uncomfortably well the relationship between the average viewer and the laughtrack playing television executive
We have become so accustomed to taking the humorous reactions of others as evidence of what deserves laughter that we, too, can be made to respond to the sound and not to the sub stance of the real thing
Much as a "cheepcheep" noise removed from the reality of a chick can stimulate a female turkey to mother, so can a recorded "haha" removed from the reality of a genuine audience stimulate us to laugh
The television executives are exploiting our preference for shortcuts, our tendency to react automatically on the basis of partial evidence
They know that their tapes will cue our tapes
Click, whirr
Television executives are hardly alone in their use of social evidence for profit
Our tendency to assume that an action is more correct if others are doing it is exploited in a variety of settings
Bartenders often "salt" their tip jars with a few dollar bills at the beginning of the evening to simulate tips left by prior customers and thereby to give the impres sion that tipping with folding money is proper barroom behavior
Church ushers sometimes salt collection baskets for the same reason and with the same positive effect on proceeds
Evangelical preachers are known to seed their audience with "ringers," who are rehearsed to come forward at a specified time to give witness and donations
For 90 /   example, an Arizona State University research team that infiltrated the Billy Graham organization reported on such advance preparations prior to one of his Crusade visits
"By the time Graham arrives in town and makes his altar call, an army of six thousand wait with instructions on when to come forth at varying intervals to create the impression of a spontaneous mass outpouring." Advertisers love to inform us when a product is the "fastestgrowing" or "largestselling" because they don't have to convince us directly that the product is good, they need only say that many others think so, which seems proof enough
The producers of charity telethons devote inordinate amounts of time to the incessant listing of viewers who have already pledged contributions
The message being communicated to the holdouts is clear: "Look at all the people who have decided to give
It must be the correct thing to do." At the height of the disco craze, cer tain discotheque owners manufactured a brand of visible social proof for their clubs' quality by creating long waiting lines outside when there was plenty of room inside
Salesmen are taught to spice their pitches with numerous accounts of individuals who have purchased the product
Sales and motivation consultant Cavett Robert captures the principle nicely in his advice to sales trainees: "Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer." Researchers, too, have employed procedures based on the principle of social proof — sometimes with astounding results
One psychologist in particular, Albert Bandura, has led the way in developing such pro cedures for the elimination of undesirable behavior
Bandura and his colleagues have shown how people suffering from phobias can be rid of these extreme fears in an amazingly simple fashion
For instance, in an early study nurseryschoolage children chosen because they were terrified of dogs merely watched a little boy playing happily with a dog for twenty minutes a day
This exhibition produced such marked changes in the reactions of the fearful children that after only four days, 67 percent of them were willing to climb into a playpen with a dog and remain confined there, petting and scratching it while everyone else left the room
Moreover, when the researchers tested the children's fear levels again one month later, they found that the improvement had not evaporated during that time; in fact, the children were more willing than ever to interact with dogs
An important practical discovery was made in a second study of children who were exceptionally afraid of dogs: To reduce their fears, it was not necessary to provide live demonstrations of another child playing with a dog; film clips had the same effect
And the most effective type of clips were those depicting not one but a variety of other children   91 interacting with their dogs; apparently the principle of social proof works best when the proof is provided by the actions of a lot of other people
3 The powerful   of filmed examples in changing the behavior of children can be used as therapy for various problems
Some striking evidence is available in the research of psychologist Robert O'Connor on socially withdrawn preschool children
We have all seen children of this sort, terribly shy, standing alone at the fringes of the games and groupings of their peers
O'Connor worried that a longterm pattern of isolation was forming, even at an early age, that would create persist ent difficulties in social comfort and adjustment through adulthood
In an attempt to reverse the pattern, O'Connor made a film containing eleven different scenes in a nurseryschool setting
Each scene began by showing a different solitary child watching some ongoing social activity and then actively joining the activity, to everyone's enjoyment
O'Connor selected a group of the most severely withdrawn children from four preschools and showed them his film
The impact was im pressive
The isolates immediately began to interact with their peers at a level equal to that of the normal children in the schools
Even more astonishing was what O'Connor found when he returned to observe six weeks later
While the withdrawn children who had not seen O'Connor's film remained as isolated as ever, those who had viewed it were now leading their schools in amount of social activity
It seems that this twentythreeminute movie, viewed just once, was enough to reverse a potential pattern of lifelong maladaptive behavior
Such is the potency of the principle of social proof
When it comes to illustrations of the strength of social proof, there is one that is far and away my favorite
Several features account for its appeal: It offers a superb example of the much underused method of participant observation, in which a scientist studies a process by becom ing immersed in its natural occurrence; it provides information of in terest to such diverse groups as historians, psychologists, and theolo gians; and, most important, it shows how social evidence can be used on us — not by others, but by ourselves — to assure us that what we prefer to be true will seem to be true
The story is an old one, requiring an examination of ancient data, for the past is dotted with millennial religious movements
Various sects and cults have prophesied that on one or another particular date there would arrive a period of redemption and great happiness for those who believed in the group's teachings
In each instance it has been predicted that the beginning of the time of salvation would be marked by an im portant and undeniable event, usually the cataclysmic end of the world
92 /   Of course, these predictions have invariably proved false
To the acute dismay of the members of such groups, the end has never appeared as scheduled
But immediately following the obvious failure of the prophecy, history records an enigmatic pattern
Rather than disbanding in disillusion, the cultists often become strengthened in their convictions
Risking the ri dicule of the populace, they take to the streets, publicly asserting their dogma and seeking converts with a fervor that is intensified, not dimin ished, by the clear disconfirmation of a central belief
So it was with the Montanists of secondcentury Turkey, with the Anabaptists of sixteenth century Holland, with the Sabbataists of seventeenthcentury Izmir, with the Millerites of nineteenthcentury America
And, thought a trio of interested social scientists, so it might be with a doomsday cult based in modernday Chicago
The scientists — Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter — who were then colleagues at the University of Minnesota, heard about the Chicago group and felt it worthy of close study
Their decision to investigate by joining the group, incognito, as new believers and by placing additional paid observers among its ranks resulted in a remarkably rich firsthand account of the goingson before and after the day of predicted catastrophe
5 The cult of believers was small, never numbering more than thirty members
Its leaders were a middleaged man and woman, whom the researchers renamed, for purposes of publication
Dr
Thomas Arm strong and Mrs
Marian Keech
Dr
Armstrong, a physician on the staff of a college student health service, had a longheld interest in mysticism, the occult, and flying saucers; as such he served as a respected authority on these subjects for the group
Mrs
Keech, though, was the center of attention and activity
Earlier in the year she had begun to receive messages from spiritual beings, whom she called the Guardians, located on other planets
It was these messages, flowing through Marian Keech's hand via the device of "automatic writing," that were to form the bulk of the cult's religious belief system
The teachings of the Guardians were loosely linked to traditional Christian thought
No wonder that one of the Guardians, Sananda, eventually "revealed" himself as the current embodiment of Jesus
The transmissions from the Guardians, always the subjects of much discussion and interpretation among the group, gained new significance when they began to foretell a great impending disaster — a flood that would begin in the Western Hemisphere and eventually engulf the world
Although the cultists were understandably alarmed at first, further messages assured them that they and all those who believed in the Lessons sent through Mrs
Keech would survive
Before the calamity, spacemen were to arrive and carry off the believers in flying saucers to   93 a place of safety, presumably on another planet
Very little detail was provided about the rescue except that the believers were to make themselves ready for pickup by rehearsing certain passwords to be ex changed ("I left my hat at home." "What is your question?" "I am my own porter.") and by removing all metal from their clothes — because the wearing or carrying of metal made saucer travel "extremely danger ous." As Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter observed the preparations during the weeks prior to the flood date, they noted with special interest two significant aspects of the members' behavior
First, the level of commitment to the cult's belief system was very high
In anticipation of their departure from doomed Earth, irrevocable steps were taken by the group members
Most had incurred the opposition of family and friends to their beliefs but had persisted nonetheless in their convictions, often when it meant losing the affections of these others
In fact, several of the members were threatened by neighbors or family with legal ac tions designed to have them declared insane
In Dr
Armstrong's case, a motion was filed by his sister to have his two younger children taken away
Many believers quit their jobs or neglected their studies to devote full time to the movement
Some even gave or threw away their personal belongings, expecting them shortly to be of no use
These were people whose certainty that they had the truth allowed them to withstand enormous social, economic, and legal pressures and whose commitment to their dogma grew as each pressure was resisted
The second significant aspect of the believers' preflood actions was a curious form of inaction
For individuals so clearly convinced of the validity of their creed, they did surprisingly little to spread the word
Although they did initially make public the news of the coming disaster, there was no attempt to seek converts, to proselyte actively
They were willing to sound the alarm and to counsel those who voluntarily respon ded to it, but that was all
The group's distaste for recruitment efforts was evident in various ways besides the lack of personal persuasion attempts
Secrecy was maintained in many matters — extra copies of the Lessons were burned, passwords and secret signs were instituted, the contents of certain private tape recordings were not to be discussed with outsiders (so secret were the tapes that even longtime believers were prohibited from taking notes of them)
Publicity was avoided
As the day of disaster approached, increasing numbers of newspaper, television, and radio reporters converged on the group's headquarters in the Keech house
For the most part, these people were turned away or ignored
The most frequent answer to their questions was, "No comment." Although dis couraged for a time, the media representatives returned with a ven 94 /   geance when Dr
Armstrong's religious activities caused him to be fired from his post on the college health service staff; one especially persistent newsman had to be threatened with a lawsuit
A similar siege was re pelled on the eve of the flood when a swarm of reporters pushed and pestered the believers for information
Afterward, the researchers summarized the group's preflood stance on public exposure and recruit ment in respectful tones: "Exposed to a tremendous burst of publicity, they had made every attempt to dodge fame; given dozens of opportun ities to proselyte, they had remained evasive and secretive and behaved with an almost superior indifference." Eventually, when all the reporters and wouldbe converts had been cleared from the house, the believers began making their final prepara tions for the arrival of the spaceship scheduled for midnight that night
The scene, as viewed by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter, must have seemed like absurdist theater
Otherwise ordinary people — housewives, college students, a highschool boy, a publisher, an M.D., a hardware store clerk and his mother — were participating earnestly in tragic comedy
They took direction from a pair of members who were period ically in touch with the Guardians; Marian Keech's written messages from Sananda were being supplemented that evening by "the Bertha," a former beautician through whose tongue the "Creator" gave instruc tion
They rehearsed their lines diligently, calling out in chorus the re sponses to be made before entering the rescue saucer, "I am my own porter." "I am my own pointer." They discussed seriously whether the message from a caller identifying himself as Captain Video — a TV space character of the time — was properly interpreted as a prank or a coded communication from their rescuers
And they performed in costume
In keeping with the admonition to carry nothing metallic aboard the saucer, the believers wore clothing that had been cut open to allow the metal pieces to be torn out
The metal eyelets in their shoes had been ripped away
The women were braless or wore brassieres whose metal stays had been removed
The men had yanked the zippers out of their pants, which were supported by lengths of rope in place of belts
The group's fanaticism concerning the removal of all metal was vividly experienced by one of the researchers who remarked, twenty five minutes before midnight, that he had forgotten to extract the zipper from his trousers
As the observers tell it, "this knowledge produced a near panic reaction
He was rushed into the bedroom where Dr
Arm strong, his hands trembling and his eyes darting to the clock every few seconds, slashed out the zipper with a razor blade and wrenched its clasps free with wirecutters." The hurried operation finished, the re searcher was returned to the living room a slightly less metallic but, one supposes, much paler man
  95 As the time appointed for their departure grew very close, the believ ers settled into a lull of soundless anticipation
With trained scientists on site, we are afforded a detailed account of the events that transpired during this momentous period in the life of the group: The last ten minutes were tense ones for the group in the living room
They had nothing to do but sit and wait, their coats in their laps
In the tense silence two clocks ticked loudly, one about ten minutes faster than the other
When the faster of the two pointed to twelvefive, one of the observers remarked aloud on the fact
A chorus of people replied that midnight had not yet come
Bob Eastman affirmed that the slower clock was correct; he had set it himself only that afternoon
It showed only four minutes before midnight
These four minutes passed in complete silence except for a single utterance
When the [slower] clock on the mantel showed only one minute remaining before the guide to the saucer was due, Marian exclaimed in a strained, highpitched voice: "And not a plan has gone astray!" The clock chimed twelve, each stroke painfully clear in the expectant hush
The believers sat motionless
One might have expected some visible reaction
Midnight had passed and nothing had happened
The cataclysm itself was less than seven hours away
But there was little to see in the reactions of the people in that room
There was no talking, no sound
People sat stockstill, their faces seemingly frozen and expressionless
Mark Post was the only person who even moved
He lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes but did not sleep
Later, when spoken to, he answered monosyllabically but otherwise lay immobile
The others showed nothing on the surface, although it became clear later that they had been hit hard
Gradually, painfully, an atmosphere of despair and confusion settled over the group
They reexamined the prediction and the accompanying messages
Dr
Armstrong and Mrs
Keech reiterated their faith
The believers mulled over their predicament and dis carded explanation after explanation as unsatisfactory
At one point, toward 4 A.M., Mrs
Keech broke down and cried bitterly
She knew, she sobbed, that there were some who were beginning to doubt but that the group must beam light to those who needed it most and that the group must hold together
The rest of the believers were losing their composure, too
They were all visibly shaken and many were close to tears
It was now almost 4:30 A.M., and still no way of handling the disconfirmation had been found
By now, too
96 /   most of the group were talking openly about the failure of the escort to come at midnight
The group seemed near dissolution
In the midst of this gathering doubt, as cracks crawled through the believers' confidence, the researchers witnessed a pair of remarkable incidents, one after another
The first occurred at about 4:45 A.M., when Marian Keech's hand suddenly leapt to the task of transcribing through "automatic writing" the text of a holy message from above
When read aloud, the communication proved to be an elegant explanation for the events of that night
"The little group, sitting alone all night long, had spread so much light that God had saved the world from destruction." Although neat and efficient, this explanation was not wholly satisfying by itself; for example, after hearing it, one member simply rose, put on his hat and coat, and left
Something additional was needed to restore the believers to their previous levels of faith
It was at this point that the second notable incident occurred to meet that need
Once again, the words of those who were present offer a vivid description: The atmosphere in the group changed abruptly and so did their behavior
Within minutes after she had read the message explaining the disconfirmation, Mrs
Keech received another message instruct ing her to publicize the explanation
She reached for the telephone and began dialing the number of a newspaper
While she was waiting to be connected, someone asked: "Marian, is this the first time you have called the newspaper yourself?" Her reply was im mediate: "Oh, yes, this is the first time I have ever called them
I have never had anything to tell them before, but now I feel it is urgent." The whole group could have echoed her feelings, for they all felt a sense of urgency
As soon as Marian had finished her call, the other members took turns telephoning newspapers, wire ser vices, radio stations, and national magazines to spread the explan ation of the failure of the flood
In their desire to spread the word quickly and resoundingly, the believers now opened for public at tention matters that had been thus far utterly secret
Where only hours earlier they had shunned newspaper reporters and felt that the attention they were getting in the press was painful, they now became avid seekers for publicity
Not only had the longstanding policies concerning secrecy and publicity done an aboutface, so, too, had the group's attitude toward potential converts
Whereas likely recruits who previously visited the house had been mostly ignored, turned away, or treated with casual attention, the day following the disconfirmation saw a different story
  97 All callers were admitted, all questions were answered, attempts were made to proselyte all such visitors
The members' unprecedented will ingness to accommodate possible new recruits was perhaps best dem onstrated when nine highschool students arrived on the following night to speak with Mrs
Keech
They found her at the telephone deep in a discussion of flying saucers with a caller whom, it later turned out, she believed to be a spaceman
Eager to continue talking to him and at the same time anxious to keep her new guests, Marian simply included them in the conversation and, for more than an hour, chatted alternately with her guests in the living room and the "spaceman" on the other end of the telephone
So intent was she on proselyting that she seemed unable to let any opportunity go by
To what can we attribute the believers' radical turnabout? In the space of a few hours, they went from clannish and taciturn hoarders of the Word to expansive and eager disseminators of it
And what could have possessed them to choose such an illtimed instant — when the failure of the flood was likely to cause nonbelievers to view the group and its dogma as laughable? The crucial event occurred sometime during "the night of the flood," when it became increasingly clear that the prophecy would not be ful filled
Oddly, it was not their prior certainty that drove the members to propagate the faith; it was an encroaching sense of uncertainty
It was the dawning realization that if the spaceship and flood predictions were wrong, so might be the entire belief system on which they rested
For those huddled in the Keech living room, that growing possibility must have seemed hideous
The group members had gone too far, given up too much for their beliefs to see them destroyed; the shame, the economic cost, the mockery would be too great to bear
The overarching need of the cultists to cling to those beliefs seeps poignantly from their own words: From a young woman with a threeyearold child: I have to believe the flood is coming on the twentyfirst because I've spent all my money
I quit my job, I quit computer school



I have to believe
And from Dr
Armstrong to one of the researchers four hours after the failure of the saucermen to arrive: I've had to go a long way
I've given up just about everything
I've cut every tie
I've burned every bridge
I've turned my back on the 98 /   world
I can't afford to doubt
I have to believe
And there isn't any other truth
Imagine the corner in which Dr
Armstrong and his followers found themselves as morning approached
So massive was the commitment to their beliefs that no other truth was tolerable
Yet that set of beliefs had just taken a merciless pounding from physical reality: No saucer had landed, no spacemen had knocked, no flood had come, nothing had happened as prophesied
Since the only acceptable form of truth had been undercut by physical proof, there was but one way out of the corner for the group
They had to establish another type of proof for the validity of their beliefs: social proof
This, then, explains their sudden shift from secretive conspirators to zealous missionaries
And it explains the curious timing of the shift — precisely when a direct disconfirmation of their beliefs had rendered them least convincing to outsiders
It was necessary to risk the scorn and derision of the nonbelievers because publicity and recruit ment efforts provided the only remaining hope
If they could spread the Word, if they could inform the uninformed, if they could persuade the skeptics, and if, by so doing, they could win new converts, their threatened but treasured beliefs would become truer
The principle of social proof says so: The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more the idea will be correct
The group's assignment was clear; since the physical evidence could not be changed, the social evidence had to be

In the case of the principle of social proof, we have already had a hint of one time when it works best
Among the Chicago believers, it was a sense of shaken confidence that triggered their craving for converts
In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct
In the process of examining the reactions of other people to resolve our uncertainty, however, we are likely to overlook a subtle but import ant fact
Those people are probably examining the social evidence, too
Especially in an ambiguous situation, the tendency for everyone to be looking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a fascinating   99 phenomenon called "pluralistic ignorance." A thorough understanding of the pluralistic ignorance phenomenon helps immeasurably to explain a regular occurrence in our country that has been termed both a riddle and a national disgrace: the failure of entire groups of bystanders to aid victims in agonizing need of help
The classic example of such bystander inaction and the one that has produced the most debate in journalistic, political, and scientific circles began as an ordinary homicide case in the borough of Queens in New York City
A woman in her late twenties, Catherine Genovese, was killed in a latenight attack on her home street as she returned from work
Murder is never an act to be passed off lightly, but in a city the size and tenor of New York, the Genovese incident warranted no more space than a fraction of a column in The New York Times
Catherine Genovese's story would have died with her on that day in March 1964 if it hadn't been for a mistake
The metropolitan editor of the Times, A
M
Rosenthal, happened to be having lunch with the city police commissioner a week later
Rosenthal asked the commissioner about a different Queensbased homicide, and the commissioner, thinking he was being questioned about the Genovese case, revealed something staggering that had been uncovered by the police investigation
It was something that left everyone who heard it, the commissioner included, aghast and grasping for explanations
Catherine Genovese had not experienced a quick, muffled death
It had been a long, loud, tortured, public event
Her as sailant had chased and attacked her in the street three times over a period of thirtyfive minutes before his knife finally silenced her cries for help
Incredibly, thirtyeight of her neighbors watched the events of her death unfold from the safety of their apartment windows without so much as lifting a finger to call the police
Rosenthal, a former Pulitzer Prize — winning reporter, knew a story when he heard one
On the day of his lunch with the commissioner, he assigned a reporter to investigate the "bystander angle" of the Genovese incident
Within a week, the Times published a long, page 1 article that was to create a swirl of controversy and speculation
The first few paragraphs of that report provide the tone and focus of the burgeoning story: For more than half an hour thirtyeight respectable, lawabiding citizens in Queens watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks in Kew Gardens
Twice the sound of their voices and the sudden glow of their bedroom lights interrupted him and frightened him off
Each time he returned, sought her out, and stabbed her again
Not one person 100 /   telephoned the police during the assault; one witness called after the woman was dead
That was two weeks ago today
But Assistant Chief Inspector Frederick M
Lussen, in charge of the borough's detectives and a veteran of twentyfive years of homicide investigations, is still shocked
He can give a matteroffact recitation of many murders
But the Kew Gardens slaying baffles him — not because it is a murder, but because "good people" failed to call the police
As with Assistant Chief Inspector Lussen, shock and bafflement were the standard reactions of almost everyone who learned the story's de tails
The shock struck first, leaving the police, the newspeople, and the reading public stunned
The bafflement followed quickly
How could thirtyeight "good people" fail to act under those circumstances? No one could understand it
Even the murder witnesses themselves were bewildered
"I don't know," they answered one after another
"I just don't know." A few offered weak reasons for their inaction
For example, two or three people explained that they were "afraid" or "did not want to get involved." But these reasons do not stand up to close scrutiny: A simple anonymous call to the police could have saved Catherine Genovese without threatening the witness's future safety or free time
No, it wasn't the observers' fear or reluctance to complicate their lives that explained their lack of action; something else was going on there that even they could not fathom
Confusion, though, does not make for good news copy
So the press as well as the other media — several papers, TV stations, and magazines were pursuing followup stories by now — emphasized the only explan ation available at the time: The witnesses, no different from the rest of us, hadn't cared enough to get involved
We were becoming a nation of selfish, insensitive people
The rigors of modern life, especially city life, were hardening us
We were becoming "The Cold Society," unfeel ing and indifferent to the plight of our fellow citizens
In support of this interpretation, news stories began appearing regu larly in which various kinds of public apathy were detailed
The Times actually appears to have developed an apathy "beat" for a period fol lowing the Genovese revelations
Also supporting such an interpretation were the remarks of a range of armchair social commentators, who, as a breed, seem never to admit to bafflement when speaking to the press
They, too, saw the Genovese case as having largescale social signific ance
All used the word "apathy," which, it is interesting to note, had been in the headline of the Times's frontpage story, although they ac counted for the apathy differently
One attributed it to the effects of TV   101 violence, another to repressed aggressiveness, but most implicated the "depersonalization" of urban life with its "megalopolitan societies" and its "alienation of the individual from the group." Even Rosenthal, the newsman who first broke the story and who ultimately made it the subject of a book, subscribed to the citycaused apathy theory
Nobody can say why the thirtyeight did not lift the phone while Miss Genovese was being attacked, since they cannot say them selves
It can be assumed, however, that their apathy was indeed one of the bigcity variety
It is almost a matter of psychological survival, if one is surrounded and pressed by millions of people, to prevent them from constantly impinging on you, and the only way to do this is to ignore them as often as possible
Indifference to one's neighbor and his troubles is a conditioned reflex in life in New York as it is in other big cities
7 As the Genovese story grew — aside from Rosenthal's book, it became the focus of numerous newspaper and magazine pieces, several televi sionnews documentaries, and an offBroadway play — it attracted the professional attention of a pair of New Yorkbased psychology profess ors, Bibb Latane and John Darley
They examined the reports of the Genovese incident and, on the basis of their knowledge of social psy chology, hit on what had seemed the most unlikely explanation of all — it was that thirtyeight witnesses were present
Previous accounts of the story had invariably emphasized that no action was taken, even though thirtyeight individuals had looked on
Latane and Darley suggested that no one had helped precisely because there were so many observers
The psychologists speculated that, for at least two reasons, a bystander to an emergency would be unlikely to help when there were a number of other bystanders present
The first reason is fairly straightforward
With several potential helpers around, the personal responsibility of each individual is reduced: "Perhaps someone else will give or call for aid, perhaps someone else already has." So with everyone thinking that someone else will help or has helped, no one does
The second reason is the more psychologically intriguing one; it is founded on the principle of social proof and involves the pluralistic ignorance effect
Very often an emergency is not obviously an emer gency
Is the man lying in the alley a heartattack victim or a drunk sleeping one off? Are the sharp sounds from the street gunshots or truck backfires? Is the commotion next door an assault requiring the police or an especially loud marital spat where intervention would be inappro priate and unwelcome? What is going on? In times of such uncertainty, the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues
102 /   We can learn, from the way the other witnesses are reacting, whether the event is or is not an emergency
What is easy to forget, though, is that everybody else observing the event is likely to be looking for social evidence, too
And because we all prefer to appear poised and unflustered among others, we are likely to search for that evidence placidly, with brief, camouflaged glances at those around us
Therefore everyone is likely to see everyone else looking unruffled and failing to act
As a result, and by the principle of social proof, the event will be roundly interpreted as a nonemergency
This, according to Latane and Darley, is the state of pluralistic ignorance "in which each person decides that since nobody is concerned, nothing is wrong
Meanwhile, the danger may be mounting to the point where a single individual, un d by the seeming calm of others, would react." 8 The fascinating upshot of Latane and Darley's reasoning is that, for the emergency victim, the idea of "safety in numbers" may often be completely wrong
It might be that someone in need of emergency aid would have a better chance of survival if a single bystander, rather than a crowd, was present
To test this unusual thesis, Darley, Latane, their students and colleagues performed a systematic and impressive program of research that produced a clear set of findings
Their basic procedure was to stage emergency events that were observed either by a single individual or by a group of people
They then recorded the number of times the emergency victim received help under those circumstances
In their first experiment, a New York college student who appeared to be having an epileptic seizure received help 85 percent of the time when there was a single bystander present but only 31 percent of the time with five bystanders present
With almost all the single bystanders helping, it becomes difficult to argue that ours is "The Cold Society" where no one cares for suffering others
Obviously it was something about the presence of other bystanders that reduced helping to shameful levels
Other studies have examined the importance of social proof in causing widespread witness "apathy." They have done so by planting within a group of witnesses to a possible emergency people who are rehearsed to act as if no emergency were occurring
For instance, in another New York — based experiment, 75 percent of lone individuals who observed smoke seeping from under a door reported the leak; however, when similar leaks were observed by threeperson groups, the smoke was reported only 38 percent of the time
The smallest number of bystanders took action, though, when the threeperson groups included two indi viduals who had been coached to ignore the smoke; under those condi tions, the leaks were reported only 10 percent of the time
In a similar   103 study conducted in Toronto, single bystanders provided emergency aid 90 percent of the time, whereas such aid occurred in only 16 percent of the cases when a bystander was in the presence of two other bystanders who remained passive
After more than a decade of such research, social scientists now have a good idea of when a bystander will offer emergency aid
First, and contrary to the view that we have become a society of callous, uncaring people, once witnesses are convinced that an emergency situation exists, aid is very likely
Under these conditions, the numbers of bystanders who either intervene themselves or summon help is quite comforting
For example, in four separate experiments done in Florida, accident scenes involving a maintenance man were staged
When it was clear that the man was hurt and required assistance, he was helped 100 per cent of the time in two of the experiments
In the other two experiments, where helping involved contact with potentially dangerous electrical wires, the victim still received bystander aid in 90 percent of the in stances
In addition, these extremely high levels of assistance occurred whether the witnesses observed the event singly or in groups
9 The situation becomes very different when, as in many cases, bystanders cannot be sure that the event they are witnessing is an emergency
Then a victim is much more likely to be helped by a lone bystander than by a group, especially if the people in the group are strangers to one another
It seems that the pluralistic ignorance effect is strongest among strangers: Because we like to look poised and sophisticated in public and because we are unfamiliar with the reactions of those we do not know, we are unlikely to give off or correctly read expressions of concern when in a grouping of strangers
Therefore, a possible emergency becomes viewed as a nonemergency, and the victim suffers
10 A close look at this set of research findings reveals an enlightening pattern
All the conditions that decrease an emergency victim's chances for bystander aid exist normally and innocently in the city: (1) In contrast to rural areas, cities are more clamorous, distracting, rapidly changing places where it is difficult to be certain of the nature of the events one encounters
(2) Urban environments are more populous, by their nature; consequently, people are more likely to be with others when witnessing a potential emergency situation
(3) City dwellers know a much smaller percentage of fellow residents than do people who live in small towns; therefore, city dwellers are more likely to find themselves in a group of strangers when observing an emergency
These three natural characteristics of urban environments — their confusion, their populousness, and their low levels of acquaintance ship — fit in very well with the factors shown by research to decrease 104 /   bystander aid
Without ever having to resort to such sinister concepts as "urban depersonalization" and "megalopolitan alienation," then, we can explain why so many instances of bystander inaction occur in our cities
Devictimizing Yourself But explaining the dangers of modern urban life in less ominous terms does not dispel them
And as the world's populations move increasingly to the cities — half of all humanity will be city dwellers within ten years — there will be a growing need to reduce those dangers
Fortu nately, our newfound understanding of the bystander "apathy" process offers real hope
Armed with this scientific knowledge, an emergency victim can increase enormously the chances of receiving aid from others
The key is the realization that groups of bystanders fail to help because the bystanders are unsure rather than unkind
They don't help because they are unsure of whether an emergency actually exists and whether they are responsible for taking action
When they are sure of their re sponsibilities for intervening in a clear emergency, people are exceed ingly responsive! Once it is understood that the enemy is not some unmanageable so cietal condition like urban depersonalization but is, instead, the simple state of uncertainty, it becomes possible for emergency victims to take specific steps to protect themselves by reducing the bystanders' uncer tainty
Imagine, for example, you are spending a summer afternoon at a music concert in the park
As the concert ends and people begin leaving, you notice a slight numbness in one arm but dismiss it as nothing to be alarmed about
Yet, while moving with the crowd to the distant parking areas, you feel the numbness spreading down to your hand and up one side of your face
Feeling disoriented, you decide to sit against a tree for a moment to rest
Soon you realize that something is drastically wrong
Sitting down has not helped; in fact, the control and coordination of your muscles has worsened to the point that you are starting to have difficulty moving your mouth and tongue to speak
You try to get up but can't
A terrifying thought slashes to mind: "Oh, God, I'm having a stroke!" Groups of people are passing by and most are paying you no attention
The few who notice the odd way you are slumped against the tree or the strange look on your face check the social evidence around them and, seeing that no one else is reacting with concern, walk on past convinced that nothing is wrong
Were you to find yourself in such a predicament, what could you do to overcome the odds against receiving help? Because your physical abilities would be deteriorating, time would be crucial
If, before you   105 could summon aid, you lost your speech or mobility or consciousness, your chances for assistance and for recovery would plunge drastically
It would be essential to try to request help quickly
But what would the most effective form of that request be? Moans, groans, or outcries probably would not do
They might bring you some attention, but they would not provide enough information to assure passersby that a true emergency existed
If mere outcries are unlikely to produce help from the passing crowd, perhaps you should be more specific
Indeed, you need to do more than try to gain attention; you should call out clearly your need for assistance
You must not allow bystanders to define your situation as a nonemer gency
Use the word "Help" to cry out your need for emergency aid
And don't worry about being wrong
Embarrassment is a villain to be crushed here
In the context of a possible stroke, you cannot afford to be worried about the awkwardness of overestimating your problem
The difference in cost is that between a moment of embarrassment and possible death or lifelong paralysis
But even a resounding call for help is not your most effective tactic
Although it may reduce bystanders' doubts about whether a real emergency exists, it will not remove several other important uncertain ties within each onlooker's mind: What kind of aid is required here? Should I be the one to provide the aid, or should someone more qualified do it? Has someone else already gone to get professional help, or is it my responsibility? While the bystanders stand gawking at you and grappling with these questions, time vital to your survival could be slipping away
Clearly, then, as a victim you must do more than alert bystanders to your need for emergency assistance; you must also remove their uncer tainties about how that assistance should be provided and who should provide it
But what would be the most efficient and reliable way to do so? Based on the research findings we have seen, my advice would be to isolate one individual from the crowd: Stare, speak, and point directly at that person and no one else: "You, sir, in the blue jacket, I need help
Call an ambulance." With that one utterance you should dispel all the uncertainties that might prevent or delay help
With that one statement you will have put the man in the blue jacket in the role of "rescuer." He should now understand that emergency aid is needed; he should understand that he, not someone else, is responsible for providing the aid; and, finally, he should understand exactly how to provide it
All the scientific evidence indicates that the result should be quick, effective assistance
106 /   In general, then, your best strategy when in need of emergency help is to reduce the uncertainties of those around you concerning your condition and their responsibilities
Be as precise as possible about your need for aid
Do not allow bystanders to come to their own conclusions because, especially in a crowd, the principle of social proof and the consequent pluralistic ignorance effect might well cause them to view your situation as a nonemergency
And request assistance of a single individual from the group of on lookers
Fight the natural tendency to make a general request for help
Pick out one person and assign the task to that individual
Otherwise, it is too easy for everyone in the crowd to assume that someone else should help, will help, or has helped
Of all the techniques in this book designed to produce compliance with a request, this one may be the most important to remember
After all, the failure of your request for emergency aid could have severe personal consequences
Not long ago, I received some firsthand evidence on this point
I was involved in a rather serious automobile collision
Both I and the other driver were plainly hurt: He was slumped, unconscious, over his steering wheel while I managed to stagger, bloody, from behind mine
The accident had occurred in the center of an intersection in full view of several individuals stopped in their cars at the traffic light
As I knelt in the road beside my door, trying to clear my head, the light changed and the waiting cars began to roll slowly through the intersection; their drivers gawked but did not stop
I remember thinking, "Oh no, it's happening just like the research says
They're all passing by!" I consider it fortunate that, as a social psychologist, I knew enough about the bystander studies to have that particular thought
By thinking of my predicament in terms of the re search findings, I knew exactly what to do
Pulling myself up so I could be seen clearly, I pointed at the driver of one car: "Call the police." To a second and a third driver, pointing directly each time: "Pull over, we need help." The responses of these people were instantaneous
They summoned a police car and ambulance immediately, they used their handkerchiefs to blot the blood from my face, they put a jacket under my head, they volunteered to serve as witnesses to the accident; one even offered to ride with me to the hospital
Not only was this help rapid and solicitous, it was infectious
After drivers entering the intersection from the other direction saw cars stopping for me, they stopped and began tending to the other victim
The principle of social proof was working for us now
The trick had been to get the ball rolling in the direction of aid
Once that was accom plished, I was able to relax and let the bystanders' genuine concern and social proof's natural momentum do the rest
  107 MONKEY ME, MONKEY DO A bit earlier we stated that the principle of social proof, like all other weapons of  , works better under some conditions than under others
We have already explored one of those conditions: uncertainty
Without question, when people are uncertain, they are more likely to use others' actions to decide how they themselves should act
But, in addition, there is another important working condition: similarity
The principle of social proof operates most powerfully when we are ob serving the behavior of people just like us
It is the conduct of such people that gives us the greatest insight into what constitutes correct behavior for ourselves
Therefore we are more inclined to follow the lead of a similar individual than a dissimilar one
That is why I believe we are seeing an increasing number of average persononthestreet testimonials on TV these days
Advertisers now know that one successful way to sell a product to ordinary viewers (who compose the largest potential market) is to demonstrate that other "ordinary" people like and use it
So whether the product is a brand of soft drink, or a pain reliever, or a laundry detergent, we hear volleys of praise from John or Mary Everyperson
More compelling evidence for the importance of similarity in determ ining whether we will imitate another's behavior comes from scientific research
An especially apt illustration can be found in a study done several years ago by Columbia University psychologists
The researchers placed wallets on the ground in various locations around midtown Manhattan to observe what would happen when they were found
The wallets all contained $2.00 in cash, a $26.30 check, and various inform ation providing the name and address of the wallet's "owner." In addi tion to this material, the wallet also contained a letter that made it evident that the wallet had been lost not once, but twice
The letter was written to the wallet's owner from a man who had found it earlier and whose intention was to return it
The finder indicated in his letter that he was happy to help and that the chance to be of service in this way had made him feel good
It was evident to anyone who found one of these wallets that this wellintentioned individual had then lost the wallet himself on the way to the mailbox — the wallet was wrapped in an envelope addressed to the owner
The researchers wanted to know how many people finding such a wallet would follow the lead of the first finder and mail it, intact, to the original owner
Before they dropped the wallets, however, the researchers varied one feature of the letter it contained
Some of the letters were written in standard English by what seemed to be an aver 108 /   age American, while the other letters were written in broken English by the first finder, who identified himself as a recently arrived foreigner
In other words, the person who had initially found the wallet and had tried to return it was depicted by the letter as being either similar or dissimilar to most Americans
The interesting question was whether the Manhattanites who found the wallet and letter would be more  d to mail the wallet if the first man who had tried to do so was similar to them
The answer was plain: Only 33 percent of the wallets were returned when the first finder was seen as dissimilar, but fully 70 percent were returned when he was thought to be a similar other
These results suggest an important qualification of the principle of social proof
We will use the actions of others to decide on proper behavior for ourselves, especially when we view those others as similar to ourselves
This tendency applies not only to adults but to children as well
Health researchers have found, for example, that a schoolbased antismoking program had lasting effects only when it used sameage peer leaders as teachers
Another study found that children who saw a film depicting a child's positive visit to the dentist lowered their own dental anxieties principally when they were the same age as the child in the film
I wish I had known about this second study when, a few years before it was published, I was trying to reduce a different kind of anxiety in my son, Chris
I live in Arizona, where backyard swimming pools abound
One re grettable consequence is that every year several young children drown after falling into an unattended pool
I was determined, therefore, to teach Chris how to swim at an early age
The problem was not that he was afraid of the water
He loved it
But he would not get into the pool without wearing his inflatable plastic inner tube, no matter how I tried to coax, talk, or shame him out of it
After getting nowhere for two months, I hired some help: a graduate student of mine — a big, strapping former lifeguard who had once worked as a swimming instructor
He failed as totally as I had
He couldn't persuade Chris to attempt even a stroke outside of his plastic ring
Around this time, Chris was attending a day camp that provided a number of activities to its members, including use of a large pool, which he scrupulously avoided
One day, shortly after the graduate student fiasco, I went to get Chris from camp a bit early and, with mouth agape, watched him run down the diving board and jump into the middle of the deepest part of the pool
Panicking, I began pulling off my shoes to jump in to his rescue when I saw him bob to the surface and paddle safely to the side of the pool — where I dashed, shoes in hand, to meet him
  109 "Chris, you can swim," I said excitedly
"You can swim!" "Yes," he responded casually, "I learned how today." "This is terrific! This is just terrific," I burbled, gesturing expansively to convey my enthusiasm
"But how come you didn't need your plastic ring today?" Looking somewhat embarrassed because his father seemed to be raving while inexplicably soaking his socks in a small puddle and waving his shoes around, Chris explained: "Well, I'm three years old, and Tommy is three years old
And Tommy can swim without a ring, so that means I can too." I could have kicked myself
Of course, it would be to little Tommy, not to a sixfoottwoinch graduate student, that Chris would look for the most relevant information about what he could or should do
Had I been more thoughtful about solving Chris's swimming problem, I could have employed Tommy's good example earlier and, perhaps, have saved myself a couple of frustrating months
I could have simply noted at the day camp that Tommy was a swimmer and then arranged with his parents for the boys to spend a weekend afternoon swimming in our pool
My guess is that Chris's plastic ring would have been abandoned by the end of the day
Any factor that can spur 70 percent of New Yorkers to return a wallet (or can reduce the likelihood that kids will take up smoking or will fear a dentist visit) must be considered impressive
Yet research findings of this sort offer just a hint of the immense impact that the conduct of similar others has on human behavior
Other, more powerful examples exist
To my mind, the most telling illustration of this impact starts with a seemingly nonsensical statistic: After a suicide has made frontpage news, airplanes — private planes, corporate jets, airliners — begin falling out of the sky at an alarming rate
For example, it has been shown that immediately following certain kinds of highly publicized suicide stories, the number of people who die in commercialairline crashes increases by 1,000 percent! Even more alarming: The increase is not limited to airplane deaths
The number of automobile fatalities shoots up as well/ What could possibly be responsible? One explanation suggests itself immediately: The same social condi tions that cause some people to commit suicide cause others to die acci dentally
For instance, certain individuals, the suicideprone, may react to stressful societal events (economic downturns, rising crime rates, international tensions) by ending it all
But others will react differently to these same events; they might become angry or impatient or nervous or distracted
To the degree that such people operate (or service) the 110 /   cars and planes of our society, the vehicles will be less safe, and, con sequently, we will see a sharp increase in the number of automobile and air fatalities
According to this "social conditions" interpretation, then, some of the same societal factors that cause intentional deaths also cause acci dental ones, and that is why we find so strong a connection between suicide stories and fatal crashes
But another fascinating statistic indic ates that this is not the correct explanation: Fatal crashes increase dra matically only in those regions where the suicide has been highly pub licized
Other places, existing under similar social conditions, whose newspapers have not publicized the story, have shown no comparable jump in such fatalities
Furthermore, within those areas where newspa per space has been allotted, the wider the publicity given the suicide, the greater has been the rise in subsequent crashes
Thus it is not some set of common societal events that stimulates suicides on the one hand, and fatal accidents on the other
Instead it is the publicized suicide story itself that produces the car and plane wrecks
To explain the strong association between suicidestory publicity and subsequent crashes, a "bereavement" account has been suggested
Be cause, it has been argued, frontpage suicides often involve wellknown and respected public figures, perhaps their highly publicized deaths throw many people into states of shocked sadness
Stunned and preoc cupied, these individuals become careless around cars and planes
The consequence is the sharp increase in deadly accidents involving such vehicles that we see after frontpage suicide stories
Although the be reavement theory can account for the connection between the degree of publicity given a story and subsequent crash fatalities — the more people who learn of the suicide, the larger number of bereaved and careless individuals there will be — it cannot explain yet another startling fact: Newspaper stories reporting on suicide victims who died alone produce an increase in the frequency of singlefatality wrecks only, whereas stories reporting on suicideplusmurder incidents produce an increase in multiplefatality wrecks only
Simple bereavement could not cause such a pattern
The   of suicide stories on car and plane crashes, then, is fantastically specific
Stories of pure suicides, in which only one person dies, generate wrecks in which only one person dies; stories of suicide murder combinations, in which there are multiple deaths, generate wrecks in which there are multiple deaths
If neither "social conditions" nor "bereavement" account for this bewildering array of facts, what can? There is a sociologist at the University of California at San Diego who thinks he has found the answer
His name is David Phillips, and he points a convincing finger at something called the "Werther effect."   111 The story of the Werther effect is both chilling and intriguing
More than two centuries ago, the great man of German literature, Johann von Goethe, published a novel entitled Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Werther)
The book, in which the hero, named Werther, commits suicide, had a remarkable impact
Not only did it provide Goethe with immediate fame, but it also sparked a wave of emulative suicides across Europe
So powerful was this effect that authorities in several countries banned the novel
Professor Phillips's own work has traced the Werther effect to modern times
His research has demonstrated that immediately following a frontpage suicide story the suicide rate increases dramatically in those geographical areas where the story has been highly publicized
It is Phillips's argument that certain troubled people who read of another's selfinflicted death kill themselves in imitation
In a morbid illustration of the principle of social proof, these people decide how they should act on the basis of how some other troubled person has acted
Phillips got his evidence for the modernday Werther effect by ex amining the suicide statistics in the United States between 1947 and 1968
He found that within two months after every frontpage suicide story, an average of fiftyeight more people than usual killed themselves
In a sense, each suicide story killed fiftyeight people who otherwise would have gone on living
Phillips also found that this tendency for suicides to beget suicides occurred principally in those parts of the country where the first suicide was highly publicized and that the wider the publicity given the first suicide, the greater the number of later suicides
If the facts surrounding the Werther effect seem to you suspiciously like those surrounding the   of suicide stories on air and traffic fatalities, the similarities have not been lost on Professor Phillips either
In fact, he contends that all the excess deaths following a frontpage suicide incident can be explained as the same thing: copycat suicides
Upon learning of another's suicide, an uncomfortably large number of people decide that suicide is an appropriate action for themselves as well
Some of these individuals then proceed to commit the act in a straightforward, nobonesaboutit fashion, causing the suicide rate to jump
Others, however, are less direct
For any of several reasons — to protect their reputations, to spare their families the shame and hurt, to allow their dependents to collect on insurance policies — they do not want to appear to have killed themselves
They would rather seem to have died accidentally
So, purposively but furtively, they cause the wreck of a car or a plane they are operating or are simply riding in
This could be accomplished in a variety of alltoofamiliarsounding ways
A commer 112 /   cialairline pilot could dip the nose of the aircraft at a crucial point of takeoff or could inexplicably land on an already occupied runway against instructions from the control tower; the driver of a car could suddenly swerve into a tree or into oncoming traffic; a passenger in an automobile or corporate jet could incapacitate the operator, causing a deadly crash; the pilot of a private plane could, despite all radio warn ings, plow into another aircraft
Thus the alarming climb in crash fatalities we find following frontpage suicides is, according to Dr
Phillips, most likely due to the Werther effect secretly applied
I consider this insight brilliant
First, it explains all of the data beauti fully
If these wrecks really are hidden instances of imitative suicide, it makes sense that we should see an increase in the wrecks after suicide stories appear
And it makes sense that the greatest rise in wrecks should occur after the suicide stories that have been most widely publicized and have, consequently, reached the most people
And it makes sense that the number of crashes should jump appreciably only in those geographical areas where the suicide stories were publicized
And it even makes sense that single victim suicides should lead only to single victim crashes, whereas multiplevictim suicide incidents should lead only to multiplevictim crashes
Imitation is the key
But there is a second valuable feature of Phillips's insight
Not only does it allow us to explain the existing facts, it also allows us to predict new facts that had never been uncovered before
For example, if the abnormally frequent crashes following publicized suicides are genuinely due to imitative rather than accidental actions, they should be more deadly as a result
That is, people trying to kill themselves will likely arrange (with a foot on the accelerator instead of the brake, with the nose of the plane down instead of up) for the impact to be as lethal as possible
The consequence should be quick and sure death
When Phillips examined the records to check on this prediction, he found that the average number of people killed in a fatal crash of a commercial airliner is more than three times greater if the crash happened one week after a frontpage suicide story than if it happened one week before
A similar phenomenon can be found in traffic statistics, where there is evidence for the deadly efficiency of postsuicidestory auto crashes
Victims of fatal car wrecks that follow frontpage suicide stories die four times more quickly than normal
Still another fascinating prediction flows from Phillips's idea
If the increase in wrecks following suicide stories truly represents a set of copycat deaths, then the imitators should be most likely to copy the suicides of people who are similar to them
The principle of social proof states that we use information about how others have behaved to help us determine proper conduct for ourselves
But as the droppedwallet   113 experiment showed, we are most  d in this fashion by the ac tions of others like us
Therefore, Phillips reasoned, if the principle of social proof is behind the phenomenon, there should be some clear similarity between the victim of the highly publicized suicide and those who cause subsequent wrecks
Realizing that the clearest test of this possibility would come from the records of automobile crashes involving a single car and a lone driver, Phillips compared the age of the suicidestory victim with the ages of the lone drivers killed in singlecar crashes immediately after the story appeared in print
Once again the predictions were strikingly accurate: When the newspaper detailed the suicide of a young person, it was young drivers who then piled their cars into trees, poles, and embankments with fatal results; but when the news story concerned an older person's suicide, older drivers died in such crashes
This last statistic is the crusher for me
I am left wholly convinced and, simultaneously, wholly amazed by it
Evidently, the principle of social proof is so wideranging and powerful that its domain extends to the fundamental decision for life or death
Professor Phillips's findings have persuaded me of a distressing tendency for suicide publicity to motivate certain people who are similar to the victim to kill them selves — because they now find the idea of suicide more legitimate
Truly frightening are the data indicating that many innocent people die in the bargain
A glance at the graphs documenting the undeniable increase in traffic and air fatalities following publicized suicides, espe cially those involving murder, is enough to cause concern for one's own safety
I have been sufficiently affected by these statistics to begin to take note of frontpage suicide stories and to change my behavior in the period after their appearance
I try to be especially cautious behind the wheel of my car
I am reluctant to take extended trips requiring a lot of air travel
If I must fly during such a period, I purchase substan tially more flight insurance than I normally would
Dr
Phillips has done us a service by demonstrating that the odds for survival when we travel change measurably for a time following the publication of certain kinds of frontpage suicide stories
It would seem only prudent to play those odds
As if the frightening features of Phillips's suicide data weren't enough, his subsequent research brings more cause for alarm: Homicides in this country have a stimulated, copycat character after highly publicized acts of violence
Heavyweight championship prize fights that receive coverage on network evening news appear to produce measurable in creases in the U.S
homicide rate
This analysis of heavyweight champi onship fights (between 1973 and 1978) is perhaps most compelling in its demonstration of the remarkably specific nature of the imitative 114 /   aggression that is generated
When such a match was lost by a black fighter, the homicide rate during the following ten days rose signific antly for young black male victims but not young white males
On the other hand, when a white fighter lost a match, it was young white men but not young black men who were killed more frequently in the next ten days
14 When these results are combined with the parallel findings in Phillips's suicide data, it is clear that widely publicized aggression has the nasty tendency to spread to similar victims, no matter whether the aggression is inflicted on the self or on another
Work like Dr
Phillips's helps us appreciate the awesome   of the behavior of similar others
Once the enormity of that force is re cognized, it becomes possible to understand perhaps the most spectac ular act of compliance of our time — the mass suicide at Jonestown, Guyana
Certain crucial features of that event deserve review
The People's Temple was a cultlike organization that began in San Francisco and drew its recruits from the poor of that city
In 1977, the Reverend Jim Jones — who was the group's undisputed political, social, and spiritual leader — moved the bulk of the membership with him to a jungle settlement in Guyana, South America
There, the People's Temple existed in relative obscurity until November 18, 1978, when four men of a factfinding party led by Congressman Leo J
Ryan were murdered as they tried to leave Jonestown by plane
Convinced that he would be arrested and implicated in the killings and that the demise of the People's Temple would result, Jones sought to control the end of the Temple in his own way
He gathered the entire community around him and issued a call for each person's death in a unified act of selfdestruction
The first response was that of a young woman who calmly ap proached the now famous vat of strawberryflavored poison, admin istered one dose to her baby, one to herself, and then sat down in a field, where she and her child died in convulsions within four minutes
Others followed steadily in turn
Although a handful of Jones to wners escaped rather than comply and a few others are reported to have res isted, the survivors claim that the great majority of the 910 people who died did so in an orderly, willful fashion
News of the event shocked us
The broadcast media and the papers provided a barrage of reports, updates, and analyses
For days, our conversations were full of the topic: "How many have they found dead now?" "A guy who escaped says they were drinking the poison like they were hypnotized or something." "What were they doing down in South America, anyway?" "It's so hard to believe
What caused it?" Yes, "What caused it?" — the critical question
How are we to account   115 for this most astounding of compliant acts? Various explanations have been offered
Some have focused on the charisma of Jim Jones, a man whose style allowed him to be loved like a savior, trusted like a father, and treated like an emperor
Other explanations have pointed to the kind of people who were attracted to the People's Temple
They were mostly poor and uneducated individuals who were willing to give up their freedoms of thought and action for the safety of a place where all decisions would be made for them
Still other explanations have em phasized the quasireligious nature of the People's Temple, in which unquestioned faith in the cult's leader was assigned highest priority
No doubt each of these features of Jonestown has merit in explaining what happened there
But I do not find them sufficient
After all, the world abounds with cults populated by dependent people who are led by a charismatic figure
What's more, there has never been a shortage of this combination of circumstances in the past
Yet virtually nowhere do we find evidence of an event even approximating the Jonestown incident among such groups
There must be something else that was critical
One especially revealing question gives us a clue: "If the community had remained in San Francisco, would Rev
Jim Jones's suicide command have been obeyed?" A highly speculative question to be sure, but the expert most familiar with the People's Temple has no doubt about the answer
Dr
Louis Jolyon West, chairman of psychiatry and biobehavi oral sciences at UCLA and director of its neuropsychiatric unit, is an authority on cults who had observed the People's Temple for eight years prior to the Jonestown deaths
When interviewed in the immediate aftermath, he made what strikes me as an inordinately instructive statement: "This wouldn't have happened in California
But they lived in total alienation from the rest of the world in a jungle situation in a hostile country." Although lost in the welter of commentary following the tragedy
Dr
West's observation, together with what we know about the principle of social proof, seems to me quite important to a satisfactory understand ing of the compliant suicides
To my mind, the single act in the history of the People's Temple that most contributed to the members' mindless compliance that day occurred a year earlier with the relocation of the Temple to a jungled country of unfamiliar customs and strange people
If we are to believe the stories of Jim Jones's malevolent genius, he realized fully the massive psychological impact such a move would have on his followers
All at once, they found themselves in a place they knew nothing about
South America, and the rain forests of Guyana, especially, were unlike anything they had experienced in San Francisco
116 /   The country — both physical and social — into which they were dropped must have seemed dreadfully uncertain
Ah, uncertainty — the righthand man of the principle of social proof
We have already seen that when people are uncertain, they look to the actions of others to guide their own actions
In the alien, Guyanese en vironment, then
Temple members were very ready to follow the lead of others
But as we have also seen, it is others of a special kind whose behavior will be most unquestioningly followed — similar others
And therein lies the awful beauty of the Reverend Jim Jones's relocation strategy
In a country like Guyana, there were no similar others for a Jonestown resident but the people of Jonestown itself
What was right for a member of the community was determined to a disproportionate degree by what other community members — influ enced heavily by Jones — did and believed
When viewed in this light, the terrible orderliness, the lack of panic, the sense of calm with which these people moved to the vat of poison and to their deaths, seems more comprehensible
They hadn't been hypnotized by Jones; they had been convinced — partly by him but, more important, also by the principle of social proof — that suicide was correct conduct
The uncertainty they surely felt upon first hearing the death command must have caused them to look to those around them for a definition of the appropriate response
It is particularly worth noting that they found two impressive pieces of social evidence, each pointing in the same direction
The first was the initial set of their compatriots, who quickly and willingly took the poison drafts
There will always be a few such fanat ically obedient individuals in any strongleaderdominated group
Whether, in this instance, they had been specially instructed beforehand to serve as examples or whether they were just naturally the most compliant with Jones's wishes is difficult to know
No matter; the psy chological effect of the actions of those individuals must have been potent
If the suicides of similar others in news stories can   total strangers to kill themselves, imagine how enormously more com pelling such an act would be when performed without hesitation by one's neighbors in a place like Jonestown
The second source of social evidence came from the reactions of the crowd itself
Given the conditions, I suspect that what occurred was a largescale instance of the pluralistic ignorance phenomenon that fre quently infects onlookers at emergencies
Each Jones to wner looked to the actions of surrounding individuals to assess the situation and — finding seeming calm because everyone else, too, was surrepti tiously assessing rather than reacting — "learned" that patient turn taking was the correct behavior
Such misinterpreted but nonetheless convin cing social evidence would be expected to result precisely in the ghastly   117 composure of the assemblage that waited in the tropics of Guyana for businesslike death
From my own perspective, most attempts to analyze the Jonestown incident have focused too much on the personal qualities of Jim Jones
Although he was without question a man of rare dynamism, the power he wielded strikes me as coming less from his remarkable personal style than from his understanding of fundamental psychological principles
His real genius as a leader was his realization of the limitations of indi vidual leadership
No leader can hope to persuade, regularly and single handedly, all the members of the group
A forceful leader can reasonably expect, however, to persuade some sizable proportion of group mem bers
Then the raw information that a substantial number of group members has been convinced can, by itself, convince the rest
Thus the most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in their favor
It is in this that Jones appears to have been inspired
His masterstroke was the decision to move the People's Temple community from its roots in urban San Francisco to the remoteness of equatorial South America, where the conditions of uncertainty and exclusive similarity would make the principle of social proof operate for him as perhaps nowhere else
There, a settlement of a thousand people, much too large to be held in persistent sway by the force of one man's personality, could be changed from a following into a herd
As slaughterhouse operators have long known, the mentality of a herd makes it easy to manage
Simply get some members moving in the desired direction and the others — re sponding not so much to the lead animal as to those immediately sur rounding them — will peacefully and mechanically go along
The powers of the amazing Reverend Jim Jones, then, are probably best understood not in terms of his dramatic personal style, but in his profound know ledge of the art of social jujitsu
HOW TO SAY NO This chapter began with an account of the relatively harmless practice of laugh tracking and has moved on to stories of murder and suicide — all explained by the principle of social proof
How can we expect to defend ourselves against a weapon of   that pervades such a vast range of behavior? The difficulty is compounded by the realization that most of the time, we don't want to guard against the information that social proof provides
The evidence it offers about how we should act is usu ally valid and valuable
With it we can cruise confidently through a 118 /   myriad of decisions without personally having to investigate the detailed pros and cons of each
In this sense, the principle of social proof equips us with a wonderful kind of automaticpilot device not unlike that aboard most aircraft
Yet there are occasional but real problems with automatic pilots
Those problems appear whenever the flight information locked into the control mechanism is wrong
In these instances, we will be taken off course
Depending on the size of the error, the consequences can be severe
But, because the automatic pilot afforded by the principle of social proof is more often an ally than an enemy, we can't be expected to want simply to disconnect it
Thus we are faced with a classic prob lem: how to make use of a piece of equipment that simultaneously be nefits and imperils our welfare
Fortunately, there is a way out of the dilemma
Because the disadvant ages of automatic pilots arise principally when incorrect data have been put into the control system, our best defense against these disadvantages is to recognize when the data are in error
If we can become sensitive to situations where the socialproof automatic pilot is working with inaccurate information, we can disengage the mechanism and grasp the controls when we need to
There are two types of situation in which incorrect data cause the principle of social proof to give us poor counsel
The first occurs when the social evidence has been purposely falsified
Invariably these situ ations are manufactured by exploiters intent on creating the impres sion — reality be damned — that a multitude is performing the way the exploiters want us to perform
The canned laughter of TV comedy shows, which we have already discussed, is one variety of faked data of this sort
But there is a great deal more; and much of the fakery is strikingly obvious
For instance, canned responses are not unique to the electronic media or even to the electronic age
In fact, the heavyhanded exploitation of the principle of social proof can be traced through the history of one of our most venerable art forms: grand opera
This is the phenomenon called claquing, said to have been begun in 1820 by a pair of Paris opera house habitues named Sauton and Porcher
The men were more than operagoers, though
They were businessmen whose product was ap plause
Organizing under the title L'Assurance des Succes Dramatiques, they leased themselves and their employees to singers and opera managers who wished to be assured of an appreciative audience response
So ef fective were they in stimulating genuine audience reaction with their rigged reactions that before long claques (usually consisting of a lead   119 er — chefde claque — and several individual claqueurs) had become an es tablished and persistent tradition throughout the world of opera
As music historian Robert Sabin notes, "By 1830 the claque was a fullbloom institution, collecting by day, applauding by night, all in the honest open...
But it is altogether probable that neither Sauton, nor his ally Porcher, had a notion of the extent to which their scheme of paid ap plause would be adopted and applied wherever opera is sung." As claquing grew and developed, its practitioners offered an array of styles and strengths
In the same way that laughtrack producers can hire individuals who excel in titters, chuckles, or belly laughs, the claques spawned their own specialists — the pleureuse, chosen for her ability to weep on cue; the bisseur, who called "bis'' (repeat) and "encore" in ecstatic tones; and in direct kinship with today's laughtrack per former, the rieur, selected for the infectious quality of his laugh
For our purposes, though, the most instructive parallel to modern forms of canned response is the conspicuous character of the fakery
No special need was seen to disguise or vary the claque, who often sat in the same seats, performance after performance, year after year, led by a chef de claque two decades into his position
Even the monetary transactions were not hidden from the public
Indeed, one hundred years after the birth of claquing, a reader of the London Musical Times could scan the advertised rates of the Italian claqueurs
Whether in the world of Rigoletto or Gilligan's Island, then, audiences have been success fully manipulated by those who use social evidence, even when that evidence has been openly falsified
For applause on entrance, if a gentleman 25 lire For applause on entrance, if a lady 15 lire Ordinary applause during performance, each 10 lire Insistent applause during performance, each 15 lire Still more insistent applause 17 lire For interruptions with "Bene!" or "Bravo!" 5 lire For a "Bis" at any cost 50 lire Wild enthusiasm — A special sum to be arranged FIGURE 45 Advertised Rates of the Italian Claque From " ordinary applause " to " ivild enthusiasm," claqueurs offered their services in an audaciously public fashion — in this case, in a 120 /   newspaper read by many of the audience members they fully expected to  
Claque, whirr
What Sauton and Porcher realized about the mechanical way that we abide by the principle of social proof is understood as well by a variety of today's exploiters
They see no need to hide the manufactured nature of the social evidence they provide — witness the amateurish quality of the average TV laugh track
They seem almost smug in the recognition of our predicament: Either we must allow them to fool us or we must abandon the precious automatic pilots that make us so vulnerable to their tricks
But in their certainty that they have us trapped, such exploiters have made a crucial mistake
The laxity with which they construct phony social evidence gives us a way to fight back
Because automatic pilots can be engaged and disengaged at will, we can cruise along trusting in the course steered by the principle of social proof until we recognize that a piece of inaccurate data is being used
Then we can take the controls, make the necessary correction for the misinformation, and reset the automatic pilot
The transparency of the rigged social proof we get these days provides us with exactly the cue we need for knowing when to perform this simple maneuver
With no more cost than a bit of vigilance for plainly counterfeit social evidence, then, we can protect ourselves nicely
Let's take an example
A bit earlier, we noted the proliferation of av eragepersononthestreet ads, in which a number of ordinary people speak glowingly of a product, often without knowing that their words are being recorded
As would be expected according to the principle of social proof, these testimonials from "average people like you and me" make for quite effective advertising campaigns
They have always included one relatively subtle kind of distortion: We hear only from those who like the product; as a result, we get an understandably biased picture of the amount of social support for it
More recently, though, a cruder and more unethical sort of falsification has been introduced
Commercial producers often don't bother to get genuine testimonials
They merely hire actors to play the roles of average people testifying in an unrehearsed fashion to an interviewer
It is amazing how bald faced these "unrehearsed interview" commercials can be
The situations are obviously staged, the participants are clearly actors, and the dialogue is unmistakably prewritten
Dave Barry Knight Ridder News Service Recently I was watching TV, and a commercial came on, and the an nouncer, in a tone of voice usually reserved for major developments in   121 the Persian Gulf, said, "Now consumers can ask Angela Lansbury their questions about Bufferin!" As a normal human, the natural reaction to this announcement is: "Huh?" Meaning: "What does Angela Lansbury have to do with Buf ferin?" But this commercial featured several consumers who had appar ently been stopped at random on the street, and every one of them had a question for Angela Lansbury about Bufferin
Basically, what they asked was, "Miss Lansbury, is Bufferin a good product that I should purchase, or what?" These consumers seemed very earnest
It was as if they had been going around for months wringing their hands and saying, "I have a question about Bufferin! If only I could ask Angela Lansbury!" What we are seeing here is yet another example of a worsening problem that has been swept under the rug for too long in this nation: The invasion of Consumers From Mars
The look like humans, but they don't act like humans, and they are taking over
FIGURE 46 Just Your Average Martian on the Street Apparently I am not alone in noticing the number of blatantly phony " unrehearsed " testimonial ads these days
Humorist Dave Barry has registered their prevalence too and has labeled their inhabitants Consumers From Mars, which is a term I like and have even begun using myself
It helps remind me that, as regards my buying habits, I should be sure to ignore the tastes of these individuals who, after all, come from another planet than me
(KNIGHT RIDDER NEWS SERVICE) I know that whenever I encounter an   attempt of this sort, it sets off in me a kind of alarm with a clear directive: Attention! Atten tion! Bad social proof in this situation
Temporarily disconnect automatic pilot
It's so easy to do
We need only make a conscious decision to be alert to counterfeit social evidence, and the smug overconfidence of the ex ploiters will play directly into our hands
We can relax until their manifest fakery is spotted, at which time we can pounce
And we should pounce with a vengeance
I am speaking here of more than simply ignoring the misinformation, although this defensive tactic is certainly called for
I am speaking of aggressive counterattack
Whenever possible we ought to sting those responsible for the rigging 122 /   of social evidence
We should purchase no products featured in phony "unrehearsed interview" commercials
Moreover, each manufacturer of the items should receive a letter explaining our response and recom mending that they discontinue use of the advertising agency that pro duced so deceptive a presentation of their product
Of course, we don't always want to trust the actions of others to direct our conduct — especially in a situation important enough to warrant our personal investigation of the pros and cons, or in which we are ex perts — but we do want to be able to count on others' behavior as a source of valid information in a large array of settings
If, in such set tings, we find that we cannot trust the information to be valid because someone has tampered with the evidence, we ought to be ready to strike back
In such instances, I personally feel driven by more than the aver sion to being duped
I bristle at the thought of being pushed into an unacceptable corner by those who would undermine one of my hedges against the decisional overload of modern life
And I get a genuine sense of righteousness by lashing out when they try
If you are like me, so should you
In addition to the times when social evidence is deliberately faked, there is another time when the principle of social proof will regularly steer us wrong
In such an instance, an innocent, natural error will produce snowballing social proof that pushes us to the incorrect de cision
The pluralist ignorance phenomenon, in which everyone at an emergency sees no cause for alarm, is one example of this process
The best illustration I know, however, comes from a story of one of my students, who was a highway patrolman
After a class session in which the subject of discussion was the prin ciple of social proof, he stayed to talk with me
He said that he now understood the cause of a type of traffic accident that had always puzzled him before
The accident typically occurred on the city freeway during rush hour, when cars in all lanes were moving steadily but slowly
Events leading to the accident would start when a pair of cars, one behind the other, would simultaneously begin signaling an intention to get out of the lane they were in and into the next
Within seconds, a long line of drivers to the rear of the first two would follow suit, thinking that something — a stalled car or a construction barrier — was blocking the lane ahead
It would be in this crush to cram into the available spaces of the next lane that a collision frequently happened
The odd thing about it all, according to the patrolman, was that very often there had been no obstruction to be avoided in the first place, and by the time of the accident, this should have been obvious to anyone who looked
He said he had more than once witnessed such accidents   123 when there was a visibly clear road in front of the illfated lane switchers
The patrolman's account provides certain insights into the way we respond to social proof
First, we seem to assume that if a lot of people are doing the same thing, they must know something we don't
Espe cially when we are uncertain, we are willing to place an enormous amount of trust in the collective knowledge of the crowd
Second, quite frequently the crowd is mistaken because they are not acting on the basis of any superior information but are reacting, themselves, to the principle of social proof
So if a pair of freeway drivers decided by coincidence to change lanes at the identical moment, the next two drivers might well do the same, assuming that the forward drivers had spotted an obstruction
The resulting social evidence confronting drivers behind this group would be potent — four successive cars, all with their turn signals flashing, trying to angle into the next lane
More signal lights would go on
The social proof would be undeniable by then
For drivers to the rear, there could be no question about the correctness of switching lanes: "All those guys ahead must know something." So intent would they be upon working themselves into the next lane that, without even checking the true condition of the road before them, the drivers would begin a line long flank assault
Crash
There is a lesson here: An automaticpilot device, like social proof, should never be trusted fully; even when no saboteur has fed bad in formation into the mechanism, it can sometimes go haywire by itself
We need to check the machine from time to time to be sure that it hasn't worked itself out of sync with the other sources of evidence in the situation — the objective facts, our prior experiences, our own judgments
Fortunately, this precaution requires neither much effort nor much time
A quick glance around is all that is needed
And this little precau tion is well worth it
The consequences of singleminded reliance on social evidence can be frightening
This aspect of the social proof phenomenon always reminds me of the way certain Indian tribes — the Blackfeet, Cree, Snake, and Crow — used to hunt the North American buffalo
There are two features of buffalo that make them especially susceptible to erroneous social evidence
First, their eyes are set in their heads so that it is easier for them to see to the side than to the front
Second, when they run, as in a stampede, it is with their heads down low so they cannot see above the herd
As a result, the Indians realized, it was possible to kill tremend ous numbers of buffalo by starting a herd running toward a cliff
The animals, responding to the thundering social proof around them — and never looking up to see what lay ahead — did the rest
One astonished 124 /   observer to such a hunt described the deadly outcome of the buffalo's obsessive trust in collective knowledge
In this way, it was possible to decoy a herd toward a precipice, and cause it to plunge over en masse, the leaders being thrust over by their followers and all the rest following of their own free will
16 Certainly, a flier whose plane is locked onto automatic pilot would be wise to glance occasionally at the instrument panel and out the window
In the same way, we need to look up and around periodically whenever we are locked onto the evidence of the crowd
Without this simple safeguard against misguided social proof, our prospects might well run parallel to those of the freeway lane switchers and the North American buffalo: Crash
READER'S REPORT From a Former Racetrack Employee "I became aware of one method of faking social evidence to one's ad vantage while working at a racetrack
In order to lower the odds and make more money, some bettors are able to sway the public to bet on bad horses
"Odds at a racetrack are based on where the money is being bet
The more money on a horse, the lower (better) the odds
Many people who play the horses have surprisingly little knowledge of racing or betting strategy
Thus, especially when they don't know much about the horses in a particular race, a lot of times they'll simply bet the favorite
Because tote boards are displayed with uptotheminute odds, the public can always tell who the current favorite is
The system that a high roller can use to alter the odds is actually quite simple
The guy has in mind a horse he feels has a good chance of winning
Next he chooses a horse that has long odds (say, 15 to 1) and doesn't have a realistic chance to win
The minute the mutual windows open, the guy puts down a hundred dollars on the inferior horse, creating an instant favorite whose odds on the board drop to about 2 to 1
"Now the elements of social proof begin to work
People who are uncertain of how to bet the race look to the tote board to see which horse the early bettors have decided is a favorite, and they follow
A snowballing effect now occurs as other people continue to bet the favor ite
At this point, the high roller can go back to the window and bet heavily on his true favorite, which will have better odds now because the 'new favorite' has pushed down the board
If the guy wins, the initial hundreddollar investment will have been worth it many times over
"I've seen this happen myself
I remember one time a person put   125 down a hundred dollars on a prerace 10tol shot, making it the early favorite
The rumors started circulating around the track — people knew something
Next thing you know, everyone (me included) was betting on this horse
It ended up running last and had a bad leg
Many people lost a lot of money
Somebody came out ahead though
We'll never know who
But he is the one with all the money
He understood the theory of social proof." Once again we can see that social proof is most powerful for those who feel unfamiliar or unsure in a specific situation and who, consequently, must look outside of themselves for evidence of how best to behave there
Chapter 5 LIKING The Friendly Thief The main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his client
— Clarence Darrow F EW PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT, AS A RULE, we most prefer to say yes to the requests of someone we know and like
What might be startling to note, however, is that this simple rule is used in hundreds of ways by total strangers to get us to comply with their re quests
The clearest illustration I know of the professional exploitation of the liking rule is the Tupperware party, which I consider the quintessential American compliance setting
Anybody familiar with the workings of a Tupperware party will recognize the use of the various weapons of   we have examined so far: reciprocity (to start, games are played and prizes won by the partygoers; anyone who doesn't win a prize gets to reach into a grab bag for hers so that everyone has received a gift before the buying begins), commitment (each participant is urged to describe publicly the uses and benefits she has found in the Tupper ware she already owns), and social proof (once the buying begins, each purchase builds the idea that other, similar people want the product; therefore, it must be good)
All the major weapons of   are present to help things along, but the real power of the Tupperware party comes from a particular arrangement that trades on the liking rule
Despite the entertaining and persuasive salesmanship of the Tupperware demonstrator, the true re   127 quest to purchase the product does not come from this stranger; it comes from a friend to every woman in the room
Oh, the Tupperware repres entative may physically ask for each partygoer's order, all right, but the more psychologically compelling requester is a housewife sitting off to the side, smiling, chatting, and serving refreshments
She is the party hostess, who has called her friends together for the demonstration in her home and who, everyone knows, makes a profit from each piece sold at her party
Simple
By providing the hostess with a percentage of the take, the Tupperware Home Parties Corporation arranges for its customers to buy from and for a friend rather than an unknown salesperson
In this way, the attraction, the warmth, the security, and the obligation of friendship are brought to bear on the sales setting
Consumer researchers Frenzer and Davis, who have examined the social ties between the hostess and the partygoers in homeparty sales settings, have affirmed the power of the company's approach: The strength of that social bond is twice as likely to determine product purchase as is preference for the product itself
The results have been remarkable
It was recently estim ated that Tupperware sales exceed $2.5 million a day! What is interesting is that the customers appear to be fully aware of the liking and friendship pressures embodied in the Tupperware party
Some don't seem to mind; others do, but don't seem to know how to avoid them
One woman I spoke with described her reactions with more than a bit of frustration in her voice: It's gotten to the point now where I hate to be invited to Tupper ware parties
I've got all the containers I need; and if I wanted any more, I could buy another brand cheaper in the store
But when a friend calls up, I feel like I have to go
And when I get there, I feel like I have to buy something
What can I do? It's for one of my friends
With so irresistible an ally as the friendship principle operating, it is little wonder that the company has abandoned retail sales outlets and has pushed the home party concept until a Tupperware party now starts somewhere every 2.7 seconds
But, of course, all sorts of other compliance professionals recognize the pressure to say yes to someone we know and like
Take, for instance, the growing number of charity organizations that recruit volunteers to canvass for donations close to their own homes
They understand perfectly how much more difficult it is for us to turn down a charity request when it comes from a friend or a neighbor
Other compliance professionals have found that the friend doesn't even have to be present to be effective; often, just the mention of the 128 /   friend's name is enough
The Shaklee Corporation, which specializes in doortodoor sales of various homerelated products, advises its salespeople to use the "endless chain" method for finding new custom ers
Once a customer admits to liking a product, he or she can be pressed for the names of friends who would also appreciate learning about it
The individuals on that list can then be approached for sales and a list of their friends, who can serve as sources for still other potential cus tomers, and so on in an endless chain
The key to the success of this method is that each new prospect is visited by a salesperson armed with the name of a friend "who sugges ted I call on you." Turning the salesperson away under those circum stances is difficult; it's almost like rejecting the friend
The Shaklee sales manual insists that employees use this system without fail: "It would be impossible to overestimate its value
Phoning or calling on a prospect and being able to say that Mr
Soandso, a friend of his, felt he would benefit by giving you a few moments of his time is virtually as good as a sale 50 percent made before you enter." The widespread use by compliance practitioners of the liking bond between friends tells us much about the power of the liking rule to produce assent
In fact, we find that such professionals seek to benefit from the rule even when already formed friendships are not present for them to employ
Under these circumstances, the professionals' compliance strategy is quite direct: They first get us to like them
There is a man in Detroit, Joe Girard, who specialized in using the liking rule to sell Chevrolets
He became wealthy in the process, making more than two hundred thousand dollars a year
With such a salary, we might guess that he was a highlevel GM executive or perhaps the owner of a Chevrolet dealership
But no
He made his money as a salesman on the showroom floor
At what he did, he was phenomenal
For twelve years straight, he won the title as the "number one car salesman"; he averaged more than five cars and trucks sold every day he worked; and he has been called the world's "greatest car salesman" by the Guinness Book of World Records
For all his success, the formula he employed was surprisingly simple
It consisted of offering people just two things: a fair price and someone they liked to buy from
"And that's it," he claimed in an interview
"Finding the salesman they like, plus the price; put them both together, and you get a deal." Fine
The Joe Girard formula tells us how vital the liking rule is to his business, but it doesn't tell us nearly enough
For one thing, it doesn't tell us why customers liked him more than some other salesperson who offered a fair price
There is a crucial — and fascinating — general question   129 that Joe's formula leaves unanswered: What are the factors that cause one person to like another person? If we knew that answer, we would be a long way toward understanding how people such as Joe can so successfully arrange to have us like them and, conversely, how we might successfully arrange to have others like us
Fortunately, social scientists have been asking the question for decades
Their accumulated evidence has allowed them to identify a number of factors that reliably cause liking
And, as we will see, each is cleverly used by compliance professionals to urge us along the road to "yes." Physical Attractiveness Although it is generally acknowledged that goodlooking people have an advantage in social interaction, recent findings indicate that we may have sorely underestimated the size and reach of that advantage
There seems to be a click, whirr response to attractive people
Like all click, whirr reactions, it happens automatically, without forethought
The re sponse itself falls into a category that social scientists call "halo effects." A halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dom inates the way that person is viewed by others
And the evidence is now clear that physical attractiveness is often such a characteristic
Research has shown that we automatically assign to goodlooking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intel ligence
Furthermore, we make these judgments without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process
Certain of the consequences of this unconscious assumption that "goodlooking equals good" scare me
For example, a study of the Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more than two and a half 1 times as many votes as unattractive candidates 
Despite such evidence of favoritism toward handsome politicians, followup research demon strated that voters do not realize their bias
In fact, 73 percent of Cana dian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had been  d by physical appearance; only 14 percent even allowed for the possibility of such  
A similar effect has been found in hiring situations
In one study, good grooming of applicants in a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable hiring decisions than did job qualifications — this, even though the in terviewers claimed that appearance played a small role in their choices
Equally unsettling research indicates that our judicial process is similarly susceptible to the  s of body dimensions and bone structure
Goodlooking people are likely to receive highly favorable treatment in the legal system
For example, in a Pennsylvania study, researchers rated the physical attractiveness of seventyfour separate 130 /   male defendants at the start of their criminal trials
When, much later, the researchers checked court records for the results of these cases, they found that the handsome men had received significantly lighter sen tences
In fact, the attractive defendants were twice as likely to avoid jail as the unattractive ones
3 In another study — this one on the damages awarded in a staged negligence trial — a defendant who was better looking than his victim was assessed an average amount of $5,623; but when the victim was the more attractive of the two, the average com pensation was $10,051
What's more, both male and female jurors ex hibited the attractivenessbased favoritism
Other experiments have demonstrated that attractive people are more likely to obtain help when in need and are more persuasive in changing the opinions of an audience
Here, too, both sexes respond in the same way
In the helping study, for instance, the betterlooking men and women received aid more often, even from members of their own sex
4 A major exception to this rule might be expected to occur, of course, if the attractive person is viewed as a direct competitor, especially a ro mantic rival
Short of this qualification, though, it is apparent that good looking people enjoy an enormous social advantage in our culture
They are better liked, more persuasive, more frequently helped, and seen as possessing better personality traits and intellectual capacities
And it appears that the social benefits of good looks begin to accumulate quite early
Research on elementaryschool children shows that adults view aggressive acts as less naughty when performed by an attractive child and that teachers presume goodlooking children to be more intelligent than their lessattractive classmates
5 It is hardly any wonder, then, that the halo of physical attractiveness is regularly exploited by compliance professionals
Because we like at tractive people and because we tend to comply with those we like, it makes sense that sales training programs include grooming hints, that fashionable clothiers select their floor staffs from among the good looking candidates, and that con men are handsome and con women pretty
Similarity But what if physical appearance is not much at issue? After all, most people possess average looks
Are there other factors that can be used to produce liking? As both researchers and compliance professionals know, there are several, and one of the most influential is similarity
We like people who are similar to us
This fact seems to hold true whether the similarity is in the area of opinions, personality traits, background, or lifestyle
Consequently, those who wish to be liked in   131 order to increase our compliance can accomplish that purpose by ap pearing similar to us in any of a wide variety of ways
Dress is a good example
Several studies have demonstrated that we are more likely to help those who dress like us
In one study, done in the early 1970s when young people tended to dress either in "hippie" or "straight" fashion, experimenters donned hippie or straight attire and asked college students on campus for a dime to make a phone call
When the experimenter was dressed in the same way as the student, the request was granted in more than two thirds of the instances; but when the student and requester were dissimilarly dressed, the dime was provided less than half the time
Another experiment shows how automatic our positive response to similar others can be
Marchers in an antiwar demonstration were found to be not only more likely to sign the petition of a similarly dressed requester, but also to do so without bothering to read it first
Click, whirr
Another way requesters can manipulate similarity to increase liking and compliance is to claim that they have backgrounds and interests similar to ours
Car salesmen, for example, are trained to look for evidence of such things while examining the customer's tradein
If there is camping gear in the trunk, the salesman might mention, later on, how he loves to get away from the city whenever he can; if there are golf balls on the back seat, he might remark that he hopes the rain will hold off until he can play the eighteen holes he has scheduled for later in the day; if he notices that the car was purchased out of state, he might ask where the customer is from and report — with surprise — that he (or his wife) was born there, too
As trivial as these similarities may seem, they appear to work
One researcher who examined the sales records of insurance companies found that customers were more likely to buy insurance when the salesperson was like them in such areas as age, religion, politics, and cigarettesmoking habits
Because even small similarities can be effective in producing a positive response to another and because a veneer of similarity can be so easily manufactured, I would advise special caution in the presence of requesters who claim to be "just like you." Indeed, it would be wise these days to be careful around salespeople who just seem to be just like you
Many sales training programs now urge trainees to "mirror and match" the customer's body posture, mood, and verbal style, as similarities alone each of these dimensions have been shown to lead to positive results/ Compliments Actor McLean Stevenson once described how his wife tricked him into 132 /   marriage: "She said she liked me." Although designed for a laugh, the remark is as much instructive as humorous
The information that someone fancies us can be a bewitchingly effective device for producing return liking and willing compliance
So, often in terms of flattery or simple claims of affinity, we hear positive estimation from people who want something from us
Remember Joe Girard, the world's "greatest car salesman," who says the secret of his success was getting customers to like him? He did something that, on the face of it, seems foolish and costly
Each month he sent every one of his more than thirteen thousand former customers a holiday greeting card containing a personal message
The holiday greeting changed from month to month (Happy New Year or Happy Thanksgiving, etc.), but the message printed on the face of the card never varied
It read, "I like you." As Joe explained it, "There's nothing else on the card
Nothin' but my name
I'm just telling 'em that I like 'em." "I like you." It came in the mail every year, twelve times a year, like clockwork
"I like you," on a printed card that went off to thirteen thousand other people, too
Could a statement of liking so impersonal, so obviously designed to sell cars, really work? Joe Girard thinks so; and a man as successful as he was at what he did deserves our attention
Joe understands an important fact about human nature: We are phe nomenal suckers for flattery
Although there are limits to our gullibil ity — especially when we can be sure that the flatterer is trying to manip ulate us — we tend, as a rule, to believe praise and to like those who provide it, oftentimes when it is clearly false
An experiment done on men in North Carolina shows how helpless we can be in the face of praise
The men in the study received comments about themselves from another person who needed a favor from them
Some of the men got only positive comments, some got only negative comments, and some got a mixture of good and bad
There were three interesting findings
First, the evaluator who provided only praise was liked best by the men
Second, this was the case even though the men fully realized that the flatterer stood to gain from their liking him
Fi nally, unlike the other types of comments, pure praise did not have to be accurate to work
Positive comments produced just as much liking for the flatterer when they were untrue as when they were true
8 Apparently we have such an automatically positive reaction to com pliments that we can fall victim to someone who uses them in an obvious attempt to win our favor
Click, whirr
When seen in this light, the ex pense of printing and mailing well over 150,000 "I like you" cards each year seems neither as foolish nor as costly as before
  133 Contact and Cooperation For the most part, we like things that are familiar to us
9 To prove the point to yourself, try a little experiment
Get the negative of an old photograph that shows a front view of your face and have it developed into a pair of pictures — one that shows you as you actually look and one that shows a reverse image (so that the right and left sides of your face are interchanged)
Now decide which version of your face you like better and ask a good friend to make the choice, too
If you are at all like a group of Milwaukee women on whom this procedure was tried, you should notice something odd: Your friend will prefer the true print, but you will prefer the reverse image
Why? Because you both will be responding favorably to the more familiar face — your friend to the one the world sees, and you to the transposed one you find in the mirror every day
10 Because of its effect on liking, familiarity plays a role in decisions about all sorts of things, including the politicians we elect
It appears that in an election booth voters often choose a candidate merely because the name seems familiar
In one controversial Ohio election a few years ago, a man given little chance of winning the state attorneygeneral race swept to victory when, shortly before the election, he changed his name to Brown — a family name of much Ohio political tradition
11 How could such a thing happen? The answer lies partially in the unconscious way that familiarity affects liking
Often we don't realize that our attitude toward something has been  d by the number of times we have been exposed to it in the past
For example, in one experiment, the faces of several individuals were flashed on a screen so quickly that later on, the subjects who were exposed to the faces in this manner couldn't recall having seen any of them before
Yet, the more frequently a person's face was flashed on the screen, the more these subjects came to like that person when they met in a subsequent interaction
And because greater liking leads to greater social  , these subjects were also more persuaded by the opinion statements of the individuals whose faces had appeared on the screen most fre quently
12 On the basis of evidence that we are more favorable toward the things we have had contact with, some people have recommended a "contact" approach to improving race relations
They argue that simply by providing individuals of different ethnic background with more expos ure to one another as equals, those individuals will naturally come to like each other better
However, when scientists have examined school 134 /   integration — the area offering the single best test of the contact ap proach — they have discovered quite the opposite pattern
School deseg regation is more likely to increase prejudice between blacks and whites than to decrease it
13 Let's stay with the issue of school desegregation for a while
However well intentioned the proponents of interracial harmony through simple contact, their approach is unlikely to bear fruit because the argument on which it is based is terribly misinformed
First of all, the school setting is no melting pot where children interact as readily with members of other ethnic groups as they do with their own
Years after formal school integration, there is little social integration
The students clot together ethnically, separating themselves for the most part from other groups
Second, even if there were much more interethnic interaction, research shows that becoming familiar with something through repeated contact doesn't necessarily cause greater liking
In fact, continued exposure to a person or object under unpleasant conditions such as frustration, conflict, or competition leads to less liking
14 And the typical American classroom fosters precisely these unpleasant conditions
Consider the illuminating report of a psychologist, Elliot Aronson, called in to consult with school authorities on problems in the Austin, Texas, schools
His description of how he found education proceeding in the standard classroom could apply to nearly any public school in the United States: In general, here is how it works: The teacher stands in front of the class and asks a question
Six to ten children strain in their seats and wave their hands in the teacher's face, eager to be called on and show how smart they are
Several others sit quietly with eyes averted, trying to become invisible
When the teacher calls on one child, you see looks of disappointment and dismay on the faces of the eager students, who missed a chance to get the teacher's approval; and you will see relief on the faces of the others who didn't know the answer...
This game is fiercely competitive and the stakes are high, because the kids are competing for the love and approval of one of the two or three most important people in their world
Further, this teaching process guarantees that the children will not learn to like and understand each other
Conjure up your own experience
If you knew the right answer and the teacher called on someone else, you probably hoped that he or she would make a mistake so that you would have a chance to display your knowledge
If you were called on and failed, or if you didn't even raise your hand to compete, you probably envied and resented   135 your classmates who knew the answer
Children who fail in this system become jealous and resentful of the successes, putting them down as teacher's pets or even resorting to violence against them in the school yard
The successful students, for their part, often hold the unsuccessful children in contempt, calling them "dumb" or "stupid." This competitive process does not encourage anyone to look benevolently and happily upon his fellow students
Should we wonder, then, why raw school desegregation — whether by enforced busing, district rezoning, or school closures — so frequently produces increased rather than decreased prejudice? When our own children find their pleasant social and friendship contacts within their own ethnic boundaries and get repeated exposure to other groups only in the competitive cauldron of the classroom, we might expect as much
Are there available solutions to this problem? One possibility might be to end our attempts at school integration
But that hardly seems workable
Even were we to ignore the inevitable legal and constitutional challenges and the disruptive societal wrangle such a retreat would provoke, there are solid reasons for pursuing classroom integration
For instance, although white students' achievement levels remain steady, it is ten times more likely that the academic performance of minority students will significantly increase rather than significantly decline after desegregation
We must be cautious in our approach to school desegregation not to throw out the baby because it is sitting in some dirty bath water
The idea, of course, is to jettison just the water, leaving the baby shining from the bath
Right now, though, our baby is soaking in the schmutzwasser of increased racial hostility
Fortunately, real hope for draining away that hostility is emerging from the research of education specialists into the concept of "cooperative learning." Because much of the heightened prejudice from classroom desegregation seems to stem from increased exposure to outside group members as rivals, these educators have experimented with forms of learning in which cooper ation rather than competition with classmates is central
Off to camp
To understand the logic of the cooperative approach, it helps to reexamine the fascinating, threedecadesold research program of Turkishborn social scientist Muzafer Sherif
Intrigued with the issue of intergroup conflict, Sherif decided to investigate the process as it developed in boys' summer camps
Although the boys never realized that they were participants in an experiment, Sherif and his associates consistently engaged in artful manipulations of the camp's social envir onment to observe the effects on group relations
136 /   It didn't take much to bring on certain kinds of ill will
Simply separ ating the boys into two residence cabins was enough to stimulate a "we vs
they" feeling between the groups; and assigning names to the two groups (the Eagles and the Rattlers) accelerated the sense of rivalry
The boys soon began to demean the qualities and accomplishments of the other group
But these forms of hostility were minor compared to what occurred when the experimenters purposely introduced compet itive activities into the factions' meetings with one another
Cabin against cabin treasure hunts, tugsofwar, and athletic contests produced name calling and physical friction
During the competitions, members of the opposing team were labeled "cheaters," "sneaks," and "stinkers." Af terward, cabins were raided, rival banners were stolen and burned, threatening signs were posted, and lunchroom scuffles were common place
At this point, it was evident to Sherif that the recipe for disharmony was quick and easy: Just separate the participants into groups and let sit for a while in their own juices
Then mix together over the flame of continued competition
And there you have it: Crossgroup hatred at a rolling boil
A more challenging issue then faced the experimenters: how to re move the entrenched hostility they had created
They first tried the contact approach of bringing the bands together more often
But even when the joint activities were pleasant ones, such as movies and social events, the results were disastrous
Picnics produced food fights, enter tainment programs gave way to shouting contests, dininghall lines degenerated into shoving matches
Sherif and his research team began to worry that in Dr
Frankenstein fashion, they might have created a monster they could no longer control
Then, at the height of the strife, they hit on a resolution that was at once simple and effective
They constructed a series of situations in which competition between the groups would have harmed everyone's interests, in which coopera tion was necessary for mutual benefit
On a daylong outing, the single truck available to go into town for food was "found" to be stuck
The boys were assembled and all pulled and pushed together until the vehicle was on its way
In another instance, the researchers arranged for an interruption of the camp's water supply, which came through pipes from a distant tank
Presented with the common crisis and realiz ing the need for unified action, the boys organized themselves harmo niously to find and fix the problem before day's end
In yet another circumstance requiring cooperation, the campers were informed that a desirable movie was available for rental but that the camp could not afford it
Aware that the only solution was to combine resources, the   137 boys rented the film with pooled money and spent an unusually con genial evening enjoying it together
The consequences, though not instantaneous, were nonetheless striking
Conjoint efforts toward common goals steadily bridged the rancorous rift between the groups
Before long, the verbal baiting had died, the jostling in lines had ended, and the boys had begun to intermix at the meal tables
Further, when asked to list their best friends, signi ficant numbers changed from an earlier exclusive naming of ingroup chums to a listing that included boys in the other group
Some even thanked the researchers for the opportunity to rate their friends again because they realized they had changed their minds since the old days
In one revealing episode, the boys were returning from a campfire on a single bus — something that would have produced bedlam before but was now specifically requested by the boys
When the bus stopped at a refreshment stand, the boys of one group, with five dollars left in its treasury, decided to treat their former bitter adversaries to milkshakes! We can trace the roots of this surprising turnabout to those times when the boys had to view one another as allies instead of opponents
The crucial procedure was the experimenters' imposition of common goals on the groups
It was the cooperation required to achieve these goals that finally allowed the rival group members to experience one another as reasonable fellows, valued helpers, and friends
And when success resulted from the mutual efforts, it became especially difficult to maintain feelings of hostility toward those who had been teammates in the triumph
16 Back to school
In the welter of racial tensions that followed school desegregation, certain educational psychologists began to see the relev ance to the classroom in Sherif's findings
If only the learning experience there could be modified to include at least occasional interethnic cooper ation toward mutual successes, perhaps crossgroup friendships would have a place to grow
Although similar projects have been under way in various states, an especially interesting approach in this direc hon — termed the "jigsaw classroom" — was developed by Elliot Aronson and his colleagues in Texas and California
The essence of the jigsaw route to learning is to require that students work together to master the material scheduled for an upcoming exam ination
This is accomplished by forming students into cooperating teams and giving each student only one part of the information — one piece of the puzzle — necessary to pass the test
Under this system the students must take turns teaching and helping one another
Everyone needs everyone else to do well
Like Sherif's campers working on tasks that could be successfully accomplished only conjointly, the students became allies rather than enemies
138 /   When tried in recently desegregated classrooms, the jigsaw approach has generated impressive results
Studies have shown that, compared to other classrooms in the same school using the traditional competitive method, jigsaw learning stimulated significantly more friendship and less prejudice between ethnic groups
Besides this vital reduction in hostility, there were other advantages: Selfesteem, liking for school, and test scores improved for minority students
And the white students benefited, too
Their selfesteem and liking for school went up, and their test performance was at least as high as that of whites in the tradi tional classes
Gains such as these cry out for more detailed explanation
What ex actly goes on in the jigsaw classroom to account for effects we had long ago lost hope of attaining in the public schools? A case study provided by Aronson helps us to understand better
It relates the experience of Carlos, a young Mexican American boy, who found himself in a jigsaw group for the first time
Carlos's job was to learn and then convey to his team information on the middle years of Joseph Pulitzer
A test on the famous newspaperman's life would soon face each group member
Aronson tells what happened: Carlos was not very articulate in English, his second language, and because he was often ridiculed when he had spoken up in the past, he had learned over the years to keep quiet in class
We might even say that Carlos and the teacher had entered into a conspiracy of silence
He would become anonymous, buried in the bustle of classroom activity, and not be embarrassed by having to stumble over answers; she, in turn, would not call on him
Her decision probably came from the purest of motives; she didn't want to hu miliate him, or watch the other kids make fun of him
But by ig noring Carlos, the teacher had, in effect, written him off
She was implying that he was not worth bothering with; at least that was the message the other kids got
If the teacher wasn't calling on Carlos, it must be because Carlos is stupid
It is likely that Carlos himself came to the same conclusion
Naturally, Carlos was quite uncomfortable with the new system, which required him to talk to his groupmates; he had a great deal of trouble communicating his paragraph
He stammered, hesitated, and fidgeted
The other kids were not helpful at all; they reacted out of their old, overlearned habit
When a kid stumbles, especially one they think is stupid, they resort to ridicule and teasing
"Aw, you don't know it," accused Mary
"You're dumb; you're stupid
You don't know what you're doing."   139 One of us, assigned to observe the group process, would inter vene with a bit of advice when she overheard such comments: "Okay, you can tease him if you want to," she said, "and that might be fun for you, but it's not going to help you learn about Joseph Pulitzer's middle years
The exam will take place in about an hour." Notice how she changed the reinforcement contingencies
Now Mary doesn't gain much from putting Carlos down, and she stands to lose a great deal
After a few days and several such ex periences, it began to dawn on these kids that the only chance they had to learn about Carlos's segment was by paying attention to what Carlos had to say
And with that realization, the kids began to develop into pretty good interviewers, sort of junior Dick Cavetts
Instead of teasing Carlos or ignoring him, they learned to draw him out, to ask the questions that made it easier for him to explain out loud what was in his head
Carlos, in turn, relaxed more, and this improved his ability to communicate
After a couple of weeks, the children concluded that Carlos wasn't nearly as dumb as they thought he was
They saw things in him they hadn't seen before
They began to like him more, and Carlos began to enjoy school more and think of his Anglo classmates not as tormentors but as friends
17 There is a tendency when faced with positive results like those from the jigsaw classroom to become overly enthusiastic about a single, simple solution to a tenacious problem
Experience should tell us that such problems rarely yield to a simple remedy
That is no doubt true in this case, as well
Even within the boundaries of cooperative learning procedures, the issues are complex
Before we can feel truly comfortable with the jigsaw, or any similar approach to learning and liking, much more research is needed to determine how frequently, in what size doses, at which ages, and in which sorts of groups cooperative strategies will work
We also need to know the best way for teachers to institute new methods — provided they will institute them at all
After all, not only are cooperative learning techniques a radical departure from the traditional, familiar routine of most teachers, they may also threaten the teacher's sense of importance in the classroom by turning over much of the instruction to the students
Finally, we must realize that compet ition has its place, too
It can serve as a valuable motivator of desirable action and an important builder of selfconcept
The task, then, is not to eliminate academic competition but to break its monopoly in the classroom by introducing regular cooperative successes that include members of all ethnic groups
1 Despite these qualifications, I cannot help but be encouraged by the 140 /   evidence to date
When I talk to my students, or even my neighbors and friends, about the prospects for cooperative learning approaches, I can feel optimism rise in me
The public schools have for so long been the source of discouraging news — sinking test scores, teacher burnout, increasing crime, and, of course, racial conflict
Now there is at least one crack in the gloom, and I find myself genuinely excited about it
What's the point of this digression into the effects of school desegreg ation on race relations? The point is to make two points
First, although the familiarity produced by contact usually leads to greater liking, the opposite occurs if the contact carries distasteful experiences with it
Therefore, when children of different racial groups are thrown into the incessant, harsh competition of the standard American classroom, we ought to see — and we do see — the worsening of hostilities
Second, the evidence that teamoriented learning is an antidote to this disorder may tell us about the heavy impact of cooperation on the liking process
But before we assume that cooperation is a powerful cause of liking, we should first pass it through what, to my mind, is the acid test: Do compliance practitioners systematically use cooperation to get us to like them so we will say yes to their requests? Do they point it out when it exists naturally in a situation? Do they try to amplify it when it exists only weakly? And, most instructive of all, do they manufacture it when it is absent? As it turns out, cooperation passes the test with colors flying
Com pliance professionals are forever attempting to establish that we and they are working for the same goals, that we must "pull together" for mutual benefit, that they are, in essence, our teammates
A host of ex amples is possible
Most are familiar, like the newcar salesman who takes our side and "does battle" with his boss to secure us a good deal
19 But one rather spectacular illustration occurs in a setting few of us would recognize firsthand, because the professionals are police inter rogators whose job is to induce suspects to confess to crime
In recent years, the courts have imposed a variety of restrictions on the way police must behave in handling suspected criminals, especially in seeking confessions
Many procedures that in the past led to admis sions of guilt can no longer be employed for fear that they will result in a judge's dismissal of the case
As yet, however, the courts have found nothing illegal in the use by the police of subtle psychology
For this reason, criminal interrogations have taken increasingly to the use of such ploys as the one they call Good Cop/Bad Cop
Good Cop /Bad Cop works as follows: A young robbery suspect, let's say, who has been advised of his rights and is maintaining his innocence, is brought to a room to be questioned by a pair of officers
One of the   141 officers, either because the part suits him or because it is merely his turn, plays the role of Bad Cop
Before the suspect even sits down
Bad Cop curses "the son of a bitch" for the robbery
For the rest of the session his words come only with snarls and growls
He kicks the prisoner's chair to emphasize his points
When he looks at the man, he seems to see a mound of garbage
If the suspect challenges Bad Cop's accusations or just refuses to answer them
Bad Cop becomes livid
His rage soars
He swears he will do everything possible to assure a maximum sentence
He says he has friends in the district attorney's office who will hear from him of the suspect's noncooperative attitude and who will prosec ute the case hard
At the outset of Bad Cop's performance, his partner
Good Cop, sits in the background
Then, slowly, he starts to chip in
First he speaks only to Bad Cop, trying to temper the burgeoning anger
"Calm down, Frank, calm down." But Bad Cop shouts back, "Don't tell me to calm down when he's lying right to my face! I hate these lying bastards!" A bit later
Good Cop actually says something in the suspect's behalf
"Take it easy, Frank, he's only a kid." Not much in the way of support, but compared to the rantings of Bad Cop, the words fall like music on the prisoner's ears
Still, Bad Cop is unconvinced
"Kid? He's no kid
He's a punk
That's what he is, a punk
And I'll tell you something else
He's over eighteen, and that's all I need to get his ass sent so far behind bars they'll need a flashlight to find him." Now Good Cop begins to speak directly to the young man, calling him by his first name and pointing out any positive details of the case
"I'll tell you, Kenny, you're lucky that nobody was hurt and you weren't armed
When you come up for sentencing, that'll look good." If the suspect persists in claiming innocence
Bad Cop launches into another tirade of curses and threats
But this time Good Cop stops him, "Okay, Frank," handing Bad Cop some money, "I think we could all use some coffee
How about getting us three cups?" When Bad Cop is gone, it's time for Good Cop's big scene: "Look, man, I don't know why, but my partner doesn't like you, and he's gonna try to get you
And he's gonna be able to do it because we've got enough evidence right now
And he's right about the D.A.'s office going hard on guys who don't cooperate
You're looking at five years, man, five years! Now, I don't want to see that happen to you
So if you admit you robbed that place right now, before he gets back
I'll take charge of your case and put in a good word for you to the D.A
If we work together on this, we can cut that five years down to two, maybe one
Do us both a favor, Kenny
Just tell me how you did it, and then let's start working on getting you through this." A full confession frequently follows
Good Cop /Bad Cop works as well as it does for several reasons: The 142 /   fear of long incarceration is quickly instilled by Bad Cop's threats; the perceptual contrast principle ensures that compared to the raving, venomous Bad Cop, the interrogator playing Good Cop will seem like an especially reasonable and kind man; and because Good Cop has in tervened repeatedly on the suspect's behalf — has even spent his own money for a cup of coffee — the reciprocity rule pressures for a return favor
The big reason that the technique is effective, though, is that it gives the suspect the idea that there is someone on his side, someone with his welfare in mind, someone working together with him, for him
In most situations, such a person would be viewed very favorably, but in the deep trouble our robbery suspect finds himself, that person takes on the character of a savior
And from savior, it is but a short step to trusted father confessor
Conditioning and Association "Why do they blame me, Doc?" It was the shaky telephone voice of a local TV weatherman
He had been given my number when he called the psychology department at my university to find someone who could answer his question — a question that had always puzzled him but had recently begun to bother and depress him
"I mean, it's crazy, isn't it? Everybody knows that I just report the weather, that I don't order it, right? So how come I get so much flak when the weather's bad? During the floods last year, I got hate mail! One guy threatened to shoot me if it didn't stop raining
Christ, I'm still looking over my shoulder from that one
And the people I work with at the station do it, too! Sometimes, right on the air, they'll zing me about a heat wave or something
They have to know that I'm not re sponsible, but that doesn't seem to stop them
Can you help me under stand this
Doc? It's really getting me down." We made an appointment to talk in my office, where I tried to explain that he was the victim of an ageold click, whirr response that people have to things they perceive as merely connected to one another
In stances of this response abound in modern life
But I felt that the ex ample most likely to help the distressed weatherman would require a bit of ancient history
I asked him to consider the precarious fate of the imperial messengers of old Persia
Any such messenger assigned the role of military courier had special cause to hope mightily for Persian battlefield successes
With news of victory in his pouch, he would be treated as a hero upon his arrival at the palace
The food, drink, and women of his choice were provided gladly and sumptuously
Should his message tell of military disaster, though, the reception would be quite different: He was summarily slain
  143 I hoped that the point of this story would not be lost on the weatherman
I wanted him to be aware of a fact that is as true today as it was in the time of ancient Persia, or, for that matter, in the time of Shakespeare, who captured the essence of it with one vivid line
"The nature of bad news," he said, "infects the teller." There is a natural hu man tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant informa tion, even when that person did not cause the bad news
The simple association with it is enough to stimulate our dislike
20 But there was something else I hoped the weatherman would get from the historical examples
Not only was he joined in his predicament by centuries of other "tellers," but also, compared to some, such as the Persian messengers, he was very welloff
At the end of our session, he said something to convince me that he appreciated this point quite clearly
"Doc," he said on his way out, "I feel a lot better about my job now
I mean
I'm in Phoenix where the sun shines three hundred days a year, right? Thank God I don't do the weather in Buffalo." The weatherman's parting comment reveals that he understood more than I had told him about the principle that was influencing his viewers' liking for him
Being connected with bad weather does have a negative effect
But on the other side of the coin, being connected with sunshine should do wonders for his popularity
And he was right
The principle of association is a general one, governing both negative and positive connections
An innocent association with either bad things or good things will   how people feel about us
z Weathermen pay price for nature's curve balls By David L
Langford Associated Press Television weather forecasters make a good living talking about the weather, but when Mother Nature throws a curve ball, they duck for cover
Conversations with several veteran prognosticators across the country this week turned up stories of them being whacked by old ladies with umbrellas, accosted by drunks in bars, pelted with snowballs and galoshes, threatened with death, and accused of trying to play God
“\ had one guy call and tell me that if it snowed over Christmas, I wouldn't live to see New Year's," said Bob Gregory, who has been the forecaster at WTHRTV in Indianapolis for nine years
Most of the forecasters claimed they are accurate 80 percent to 90 percent of the time on oneday forecasts, but longerrange predictions get tricky
And most con ceded they are simply reporting information supplied by computers and anonymous meterologists from the National Weather Service or a private agency
144 /   But it's the face on the television screen that people go after
Tom Bonner, 35, who has been with KARKTV in Little Rock, Ark., for 11 years, remembers the time a burly farmer from Lonoke, with too much to drink, walked up to him in a bar, poked a finger in his chest and said: "You're the one that sent that tornado and tore my house up

.I'm going to take your head off." Bonner said he looked for the bouncer, couldn't spot him, and replied, "That's right about the tornado, and I'll tell you something else, I'll send another one if you don't back off." Several years ago, when a major flood left water 10 feet deep in San Diego's Mission Valley, Mike Ambrose of KGTV recalls that a woman walked up to his car, whacked the windshield with an umbrella and said, "This rain is your fault." Chuck Whitaker of WSBTTV in South Bend, Ind., says, "One little old lady called the police department and wanted the weatherman arrested for bringing all the snow." A woman upset that it had rained for her daughter's wedding called Tom Jolls of WKBWTV in Buffalo, N.Y., to give him a piece of her mind
"She held me re sponsible and said if she ever met me she would probably hit me," he said
Sonny Eliot of WJBKTV, a forecaster in the Detroit area for 30 years, recalls predicting 2 to 4 inches of snow in the city several years ago and more than 8 came down
To retaliate, his colleagues at the station set up a contraption that rained about 200 galoshes on him while he was giving the forecast the next day
"I've still got the lumps to prove it," he says
FIGURE 52 Weatherbeaten Note the similarities between the account of the weatherman zvho came to my office and those of other TV weather reporters
(DAVID L
LANGFORD, ASSOCIATED PRESS ) Our instruction in how the negative association works seems to have been primarily undertaken by the mothers of our society
Remember how they were always warning us against playing with the bad kids down the street? Remember how they said it didn't matter if we did nothing bad ourselves because, in the eyes of the neighborhood, we would be "known by the company we kept." Our mothers were teaching us about guilt by association
They were giving us a lesson in the neg ative side of the principle of association
And they were right
People do assume that we have the same personality traits as our friends
As for the positive associations, it is the compliance professionals who teach the lesson
They are incessantly trying to connect themselves or their products with the things we like
Did you ever wonder what all those goodlooking models are doing standing around in the auto mobile ads? What the advertiser hopes they are doing is lending their   145 positive traits — beauty and desirability — to the cars
The advertiser is betting that we will respond to the product in the same ways we respond to the attractive models merely associated with it
And they are right
In one study, men who saw a newcar ad that included a seductive young woman model rated the car as faster, more appealing, more expensivelooking, and better designed than did men who viewed the same ad without the model
Yet when asked later, the men refused to believe that the presence of the young woman had in fluenced their judgments
2 Because the association principle works so well — and so uncon sciously — manufacturers regularly rush to connect their products with the current cultural rage
During the days of the first American moon shot, everything from breakfast drink to deodorant was sold with allu sions to the U.S
space program
In Olympiad years, we are told precisely which is the "official" hair spray and facial tissue of our Olympic teams
24 During the 1970s, when the magic cultural concept appeared to be "naturalness," the "natural" bandwagon was crowded to capacity
Sometimes the connections to naturalness didn't even make sense: "Change your hair color naturally," urged one popular TV commercial
The linking of celebrities to products is another way advertisers cash in on the association principle
Professional athletes are paid to connect themselves to things that can be directly relevant to their roles (sport shoes, tennis rackets, golf balls) or wholly irrelevant (soft drinks, pop corn poppers, panty hose)
The important thing for the advertiser is to establish the connection; it doesn't have to be a logical one, just a positive one
Of course, popular entertainers provide another form of desirability that manufacturers have always paid dearly to tie to their goods
But recently, politicians have caught on to the ability of a celebrity linkage to sway voters
Presidential candidates assemble stables of wellknown nonpolitical figures who either actively participate in the campaign or merely lend their names to it
Even at the state and local level, a similar game is played
Take as evidence the comment of a Los Angeles woman I overheard expressing her conflicting feelings about a California refer endum to limit smoking in public places
"It's a real tough decision
They've got big stars speaking for it, and big stars speaking against it
You don't know how to vote." If politicians are relative newcomers to the use of celebrity endorse ments, they are old hands at exploiting the association principle in other ways
For example, congressional representatives traditionally announce to the press the start of federal projects that will bring new jobs or benefits to their home states; this is true even when a represent 146 /   ative has had nothing to do with advancing the project or has, in some cases, voted against it
While politicians have long strained to associate themselves with the values of motherhood, country, and apple pie, it may be in the last of these connections — to food — that they have been most clever
For in stance, it is White House tradition to try to sway the votes of balking legislators over a meal
It can be a picnic lunch, a sumptuous breakfast, or an elegant dinner; but when an important bill is up for grabs, out comes the silverware
And political fundraising these days regularly involves the presentation of food
Notice, too, that at the typical fund raising dinner the speeches, the appeals for further contributions and heightened effort never come before the meal is served, only during or after
The advantages to this pairing of the affairs of the table with those of the state are several: For example, time is saved and the reciprocity rule is engaged
The least recognized benefit, however, may be the one uncovered in research conducted in the 1930s by the distinguished psychologist Gregory Razran
Using what he termed the "luncheon technique," he found that his subjects became fonder of the people and things they experienced while they were eating
In the example most relevant for our purposes, Razran's subjects were presented with some political statements they had rated once before
At the end of the experiment, after all the polit ical statements had been presented, Razran found that only certain of them had gained in approval — those that had been shown while food was being eaten
And these changes in liking seem to have occurred unconsciously, since the subjects could not remember which of the statements they had seen during the food service
How did Razran come up with the luncheon technique? What made him think it would work? The answer may lie in the dual scholarly roles he played during his career
Not only was he a respected independ ent researcher, he was also one of the earliest translators into English of the pioneering psychological literature of Russia
It was a literature dedicated to the study of the association principle and dominated by the thinking of a brilliant man, Ivan Pavlov
Although a scientist of varied and elaborated talent — he had, for in stance, won a Nobel Prize years earlier for his work on the digestive system — Pavlov's most important experimental demonstration was simplicity itself
He showed that he could get an animal's typical re sponse to food (salivation) to be directed toward something irrelevant to food (a bell) merely by connecting the two things in the animal's mind
If the presentation of food to a dog was always accompanied by the sound of a bell, soon the dog would salivate to the bell alone, even when there was no food to be had
  147 It is not a long step from Pavlov's classic demonstration to Razran's luncheon technique
Obviously, a normal reaction to food can be transferred to some other thing through the process of raw association
Razran's insight was that there are many normal responses to food be sides salivation, one of them being a good and favorable feeling
Therefore, it is possible to attach this pleasant feeling, this positive atti tude, to anything (political statements being only an example) that is closely associated with good food
Nor is there a long step from the luncheon technique to the compli ance professionals' realization that all kinds of desirable things can substitute for food in lending their likable qualities to the ideas, products, and people artificially linked to them
In the final analysis, then, that is why those goodlooking models are standing around in the magazine ads
And that is why radio programmers are instructed to insert the station's callletters jingle immediately before a big hit song is played
And that is even why the women playing Barnyard Bingo at a Tupperware party must yell the word "Tupperware" rather than "Bingo" before they can rush to the center of the floor for a prize
It may be "Tupperware" for the women, but it's "Bingo" for the company
Just because we are often the unaware victims of compliance practi tioners' use of the association principle doesn't mean that we don't understand how it works or don't use it ourselves
There is ample evidence, for instance, that we understand fully the predicament of a Persian imperial messenger or modernday weatherman announcing bad news
In fact, we can be counted on to take steps to avoid putting ourselves in any similar positions
Research done at the University of Georgia shows just how we operate when faced with the task of com municating good or bad news
Students waiting for an experiment to begin were given the job of informing a fellow student that an important phone call had come in for him
Half the time the call was supposed to bring good news and half the time, bad news
The researchers found that the students conveyed the information very differently, depending on its quality
When the news was positive, the tellers were sure to mention that feature: "You just got a phone call with great news
Better see the experimenter for the details." But when the news was unfavor able, they kept themselves apart from it: "You just got a phone call
Better see the experimenter for the details." Obviously, the students had previously learned that, to be liked, they should connect themselves to good news but not bad news
25 A lot of strange behavior can be explained by the fact that people understand the association principle well enough to strive to link 148 /   themselves to positive events and separate themselves from negative events — even when they have not caused the events
Some of the strangest of such behavior takes place in the great arena of sports
The actions of the athletes are not the issue here, though
After all, in the heated contact of the game, they are entitled to an occasional eccentric outburst
Instead, it is the often raging, irrational, boundless fervor of the sports fan that seems, on its face, so puzzling
How can we account for wild sports riots in Europe, or the murder of players and referees by South American soccer crowds gone berserk, or the unnecessary lavishness of the gifts provided by local fans to already wealthy American ballplayers on the special "day" set aside to honor them? Rationally, none of this makes sense
It's just a game! Isn't it? Hardly
The relationship between sport and the earnest fan is anything but gamelike
It is serious, intense, and highly personal
An apt illustra tion comes from one of my favorite anecdotes
It concerns a World War II soldier who returned to his home in the Balkans after the war and shortly thereafter stopped speaking
Medical examinations could find no physical cause for the problem
There was no wound, no brain damage, no vocal impairment
He could read, write, understand a conversation, and follow orders
Yet he would not talk — not for his doctors, not for his friends, not even for his pleading family
Perplexed and exasperated, his doctors moved him to another city and placed him in a veterans' hospital where he remained for thirty years, never breaking his selfimposed silence and sinking into a life of social isolation
Then one day, a radio in his ward happened to be tuned to a soccer match between his hometown team and a traditional rival
When at a crucial point of play the referee called a foul against a player from the man's home team, the mute veteran jumped from his chair, glared at the radio, and spoke his first words in more than three decades: "You dumb ass!" he cried
"Are you trying to give them the match?" With that, he returned to his chair and to a silence he never again viol ated
There are two important lessons to be derived from this true story
The first concerns the sheer power of the phenomenon
The veteran's desire to have his hometown team succeed was so strong that it alone produced a deviation from his solidly entrenched way of life
Similar effects of sports events on the longstanding habits of fans are far from unique to the back wards of veterans' hospitals
During the 1980 Winter Olympics, after the U.S
hockey team had upset the vastly favored Soviet team, the teetotaling father of the American goaltender, Jim Craig, was offered a flask
"I've never had a drink in my life," he reported later, "but someone behind me handed me cognac
I drank it
Yes, I did." Nor was such unusual behavior unique to parents of the players
Fans out   149 side the hockey arena were described in news accounts as delirious: "They hugged, sang, and turned somersaults in the snow." Even those fans not present at Lake Placid exulted in the victory and displayed their pride with bizarre behavior
In Raleigh, North Carolina, a swim meet had to be halted when, after the hockey score was announced, the competitors and audience alike chanted "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" until they were hoarse
In Cambridge, Massachusetts, a quiet supermarket erupted at the news into a riot of flying toilet tissue and paper towel streamers
The customers were joined in their spree — and soon led — by the market employees and manager
Without question, the force is deep and sweeping
But if we return to the account of the silent veteran, we can see that something else is revealed about the nature of the union of sports and sports fan, some thing crucial to its basic character: It is a personal thing
Whatever fragment of an identity that ravaged, mute man still possessed was engaged by soccer play
No matter how weakened his ego may have become after thirty years of wordless stagnation in a hospital ward, it was involved in the outcome of the match
Why? Because he, personally, would be diminished by a hometown defeat
How? Through the prin ciple of association
The mere connection of birthplace hooked him, wrapped him, tied him to the approaching triumph or failure
As dis tinguished author Isaac Asimov put it in describing our reactions to the contests we view, "All things being equal, you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality

.and what you want to prove is that you are better than the other person
Whomever you root for represents you; and when he wins, you win." 26 When viewed in this light, the passion of the sports fan begins to make sense
The game is no light diversion to be enjoyed for its inherent form and artistry
The self is at stake
That is why hometown crowds are so adoring and, more tellingly, so grateful toward those regularly responsible for hometeam victories
That is also why the same crowds are often ferocious in their treatment of players, coaches, and officials implicated in athletic failures
Fans' intolerance of defeat can shorten the careers of even successful players and coaches
Take the case of Frank Lay den, who abruptly quit as coach of the NBA's Utah Jazz while the team was leading the league's Midwest Division
Layden's relative success, warm humor, and widely known charitable activities in the Salt Lake City area were not enough to shield him from the ire of some Jazz supporters after team losses
Citing a brace of incidents with abusive fans, including one in which people waited around for an hour to curse at him following a defeat, Layden explained his decision: "Sometimes in the NBA, you feel like a dog
I've had people spit on me
I had a guy come up to me and say
150 /   'I'm a lawyer
Hit me, hit me, so I can sue you.' I think America takes all sports too seriously." So we want our affiliated sports teams to win to prove our own su periority
But to whom are we trying to prove it? Ourselves, certainly; but to everyone else, too
According to the association principle, if we can surround ourselves with success that we are connected with in even a superficial way (for example, place of residence), our public prestige will rise
Are sports fans right to think that without ever throwing a block, catching a ball, scoring a goal, or perhaps even attending a game, they will receive some of the glory from a hometown championship? I believe so
The evidence is in their favor
Recall that Persia's messengers did not have to cause the news, my weatherman did not have to cause the weather, and Pavlov's bell did not have to cause the food for powerful effects to occur
The association was enough
It is for this reason that, were the University of Southern California to win the Rose Bowl, we could expect people with a Southern Cal connection to try to increase the visibility of that connection in any of a variety of ways
In one experiment showing how wearing apparel can serve to proclaim such an association, researchers counted the number of school sweatshirts worn on Monday mornings by students on the campuses of seven prominent football universities: Arizona State, Louisiana State, Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, Pittsburgh, and Southern California
The results showed that many more homeschool shirts were worn if the football team had won its game on the prior Saturday
What's more, the larger the margin of victory, the more such shirts appeared
It wasn't a close, hardfought game that caused the students to dress themselves, literally, in success; instead, it was a clear, crushing conquest smacking of indisputable superiority
This tendency to try to bask in reflected glory by publicly trumpeting our connections to successful others has its mirror image in our attempt to avoid being darkened by the shadow of others' defeat
In an amazing display during the luckless 1980 season, seasonticketholding fans of the New Orleans Saints football team began to appear at the stadium wearing paper bags to conceal their faces
As their team suffered loss after loss, more and more fans donned the bags until TV cameras were regularly able to record the extraordinary image of gathered masses of people shrouded in brown paper with nothing to identify them but the tips of their noses
I find it instructive that during a lateseason contest, when it was clear that the Saints were at last going to win one, the fans discarded their bags and went public once more
All this tells me that we purposefully manipulate the visibility of our connections with winners and losers in order to make ourselves look   151 good to anyone who could view these connections
By showcasing the positive associations and burying the negative ones, we are trying to get observers to think more highly of us and to like us more
There are many ways we go about this, but one of the simplest and most pervasive is in the pronouns we use
Have you noticed, for example, how often after a hometeam victory fans crowd into the range of a TV camera, thrust their index fingers high, and shout, "We're number one! We're number one!" Note that the call is not "They're number one" or even "Our team is number one." The pronoun is "we," designed to imply the closest possible identity with the team
Note also that nothing similar occurs in the case of failure
No televi sion viewer will ever hear the chant, "We're in last place! We're in last place!" Home team defeats are the times for distancing oneself
Here "we" is not nearly as preferred as the insulating pronoun "they." To prove the point, I once did a small experiment in which students at Arizona State University were phoned and asked to describe the out come of a football game their school team had played a few weeks earlier
Some of the students were asked the outcome of a certain game their team had lost; the other students were asked the outcome of a different game — one their team had won
My fellow researcher, Avril Thorne, and I simply listened to what was said and recorded the per centage of students who used the word "we" in their descriptions
When the results were tabulated, it was obvious that the students had tried to connect themselves to success by using the pronoun "we" to describe their school team victory — "We beat Houston, seventeen to fourteen," or "We won." In the case of the lost game, however, "we" was rarely used
Instead, the students used terms designed to keep themselves separate from their vanquished team — "They lost to Mis souri, thirty to twenty," or "I don't know the score, but Arizona State got beat." Perhaps the twin desires to connect ourselves to winners and to distance ourselves from losers were combined consummately in the remarks of one particular student
After dryly recounting the score of the hometeam defeat — "Arizona State lost it, thirty to twenty" — he blurted in anguish , " They threw away our chance for a national champi onship!" 2 If it is true that, to make ourselves look good, we try to bask in the reflected glory of the successes we are even remotely associated with, a provocative implication emerges: We will be most likely to use this approach when we feel that we don't look so good
Whenever our public image is damaged, we will experience an increased desire to re store that image by trumpeting our ties to successful others
At the same time, we will most scrupulously avoid publicizing our ties to failing 152 /   others
Support for these ideas comes from the telephone study of Ari zona State University students
Before being asked about the home team victory or loss, they were given a test of their general knowledge
The test was rigged so that some of the students would fail badly while the others would do quite well
So at the time they were asked to describe the football score, half of the students had experienced recent image damage from their failure of the test
These students later showed the greatest need to manipulate their connections with the football team to salvage their prestige
If they were asked to describe the team defeat, only 17 percent used the pro noun "we" in so doing
If, however, they were asked to describe the win, 41 percent said "we." The story was very different, though, for the students who had done well on the general knowledge test
They later used "we" about equally, whether they were describing a hometeam victory (25 percent) or defeat (24 percent)
These students had bolstered their images through their own achievement and didn't need to do so through the achievement of others
This finding tells me that it is not when we have a strong feeling of recognized personal accomplishment that we will seek to bask in reflected glory
Instead, it will be when prestige (both public and private) is low that we will be intent upon using the successes of associated others to help restore image
I think it revealing that the remarkable hubbub following the Amer ican hockey team victory in the 1980 Olympics came at a time of recently diminished American prestige
The U.S
government had been helpless to prevent both the holding of American hostages in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
It was a time when, as a citizenry, we needed the triumph of that hockey team and we needed to display or even manufacture our connections to it
We should not be surprised to learn, for instance, that outside the hockey arena, in the aftermath of the win over the Soviet team, scalpers were getting a hundred dollars a pair for ticket stubs
Although the desire to bask in reflected glory exists to a degree in all of us, there seems to be something special about people who would wait in the snow to spend fifty dollars apiece for the shreds of tickets to a game they had not attended, presumably to "prove" to friends back home that they had been present at the big victory
Just what kind of people are they? Unless I miss my guess, they are not merely great sports aficionados; they are individuals with a hidden personality flaw — a poor selfconcept
Deep inside is a sense of low personal worth that directs them to seek prestige not from the generation or promotion of their own attainments, but from the generation or promotion of their associations with others of attainment
There are several varieties of   153 this species that bloom throughout our culture
The persistent name dropper is a classic example
So, too, is the rockmusic groupie, who trades sexual favors for the right to tell girlfriends that she was "with" a famous musician for a time
No matter which form it takes, the beha vior of such individuals shares a similar theme — the rather tragic view of accomplishment as deriving from outside the self
Certain of these people work the association principle in a slightly different way
Instead of striving to inflate their visible connections to others of success, they strive to inflate the success of others they are visibly connected to
The clearest illustration is the notorious "stage mother," obsessed with securing stardom for her child
Of course, wo men are not alone in this regard
In 1991 a Davenport, Iowa, obstetrician cut off service to the wives of three school officials, reportedly because his son had not been given enough playing time in school basketball games
One of the wives was eight months' pregnant at the time
Physicians' wives often speak of the pressures to obtain personal prestige by association with their husband's professional stature
John Pekkanen, who authored the book The Best Doctors in the U.S., reports that many enraged protests to his list came not from the physicians who were omitted but from their wives
In one instance that reveals the extent to which the principle of association dominates the thinking of some of these women, Pekkanen received a letter from a frantic wife along with her proof that her husband deserved to be on the list of best doctors
It was a photograph of the man with Merv Griffin
HOW TO SAY NO Because liking can be increased by many means, a proper consideration of defenses against compliance professionals who employ the liking rule must, oddly enough, be a short one
It would be pointless to con struct a horde of specific countertactics to combat each of the myriad versions of the various ways to   liking
There are simply too many routes to be blocked effectively with such a oneonone strategy
Besides, several of the factors leading to liking — physical attractiveness, familiarity, association — have been shown to work unconsciously to produce their effects on us, making it unlikely that we could muster a timely protection against them
Instead we need to consider a general approach, one that can be ap plied to any of the likingrelated factors to neutralize their unwelcome   on our compliance decisions
The secret to such an approach may lie in its timing
Rather than trying to recognize and prevent the action of liking factors before they have a chance to work on us, we might be well advised to let them work
Our vigilance should be directed 154 /   not toward the things that may produce undue liking for a compliance practitioner, but toward the fact that undue liking has been produced
The time to react protectively is when we feel ourselves liking the practitioner more than we should under the circumstances
By concentrating our attention on the effect rather than the causes, we can avoid the laborious, nearly impossible task of trying to detect and deflect the many psychological  s on liking
Instead, we have to be sensitive to only one thing related to liking in our contacts with compliance practitioners: the feeling that we have come to like the practitioner more quickly or more deeply than we would have expected
Once we notice this feeling, we will have been tipped off that there is probably some tactic being used, and we can start taking the necessary countermeasures
Note that the strategy I am suggesting borrows much from the jujitsu style favored by the compliance professionals them selves
We don't attempt to restrain the   of the factors that cause liking
Quite the contrary
We allow these factors to exert their force, and then we use that force in our campaign against them
The stronger the force, the more conspicuous it becomes and, consequently, the more subject to our alerted defenses
Suppose, for example, we find ourselves bargaining on the price of a new car with Dealin' Dan, a candidate for Joe Girard's vacated "greatest car salesman" title
After talking a while and negotiating a bit, Dan wants to close the deal; he wants us to decide to buy the car
Before any such decision is made, it would be important to ask ourselves a crucial question: "In the twentyfive minutes I've known this guy, have I come to like him more than I would have expected?" If the answer is yes, we might want to reflect upon whether Dan behaved during those few minutes in ways that we know affect liking
We might recall that he had fed us (coffee and doughnuts) before launching into his pitch, that he had complimented us on our choice of options and color combinations, that he had made us laugh, that he had cooperated with us against the sales manager to get us a better deal
Although such a review of events might be informative, it is not a necessary step in protecting ourselves from the liking rule
Once we discover that we have come to like Dan more than we would have ex pected to, we don't have to know why
The simple recognition of un warranted liking should be enough to get us to react against it
One possible reaction would be to reverse the process and actively dislike Dan
But that might be unfair to him and contrary to our own interests
After all, some individuals are naturally likable, and Dan might just be one of them
It wouldn't be right to turn automatically against those compliance professionals who happen to be most likable
Besides, for our own sakes, we wouldn't want to shut ourselves off from business   155 interactions with such nice people, especially when they may be offering us the best available deal
I would recommend a different reaction
If our answer to the crucial question is "Yes, under the circumstances, I like this guy peculiarly well," this should be the signal that the time has come for a quick countermaneuver: Mentally separate Dan from that Chevy or Toyota he's trying to sell
It is vital to remember at this point that, should we decide for Dan's car, we will be driving it, not him, off the dealership lot
It is irrelevant to a wise automobile purchase that we find Dan likable because he is goodlooking, claims an interest in our favorite hobby, is funny, or has relatives back where we grew up
Our proper response, then, is a conscious effort to concentrate exclus ively on the merits of the deal and car Dan has for us
Of course, in making a compliance decision, it is always a good idea to keep separate our feelings about the requester and the request
But once immersed in even a brief personal and sociable contact with a requester, that distinc tion is easy to forget
In those instances when we don't care one way or the other about a requester, forgetting to make the distinction won't steer us very far wrong
The big mistakes are likely to come when we are fond of the person making a request
That's why it is so important to be alert to a sense of undue liking for a compliance practitioner
The recognition of that feeling can serve as our reminder to separate the dealer from the merits of the deal and to make our decision based on considerations related only to the latter
Were we all to follow this procedure, I am certain we would be much more pleased with the results of our exchanges with compliance profes sionals — though I suspect that Dealin' Dan would not
READER'S REPORT From a Chicago Man "Although I've never been to a Tupperware party, I recognized the same kind of friendship pressures recently when I got a call from a longdistancephonecompany saleswoman
She told me that one of my buddies had placed my name on something called the MCI Friends and Family Calling Circle
"This friend of mine
Brad, is a guy I grew up with but who moved to New Jersey last year for a job
He still calls me pretty regularly to get the news on the guys we used to hang out with from the neighborhood
The saleswoman told me that he can save twenty percent on all the calls he makes to the people on his Calling Circle list, provided that they are MCIphonecompany subscribers
Then she asked me if I wanted to 156 /   switch to MCI to get all the blah, blah, blah benefits of MCI service, and so that Brad could save twenty percent on his calls to me
"Well, I couldn't have cared less about the benefits of MCI service; I was perfectly happy with the longdistance company I had
But the part about wanting to save Brad money on our calls really got to me
For me to say that I didn't want to be in his Calling Circle and didn't care about saving him money would have sounded like a real affront to our friendship when he learned of it
So, to avoid insulting him, I told her to switch me to MCI
"I used to wonder why women would go to a Tupperware party just because a friend was holding it, and then buy stuff they didn't want once they were there
I don't wonder anymore." This reader is not alone in being able to testify to the power of the pressures embodied in MCI's Calling Circle idea
When Consumer Reports magazine inquired into the practice, the MCI salesperson they interviewed was quite succinct: "It works nine out often tunes," he said
Chapter 6 AUTHORITY Directed Deference Follow an expert
— VIRGIL C UPPOSE THAT WHILE LEAFING THROUGH THE NEWSPAPER, YOU notice ^ an ad for volunteers to take part in a "study of memory" being done in the psychology department of a nearby university
Let's suppose further that, finding the idea of such an experiment intriguing, you contact the director of the study, a Professor Stanley Milgram, and make arrangements to participate in an hourlong session
When you arrive at the laboratory suite, you meet two men
One is the researcher in charge of the experiment, as is clearly evidenced by the gray lab coat he wears and the clipboard he carries
The other is a volunteer like yourself who seems average in all respects
After initial greetings and pleasantries are exchanged, the researcher begins to explain the procedures to be followed
He says that the exper iment is a study of how punishment affects learning and memory
Therefore, one participant will have the task of learning pairs of words in a long list until each pair can be recalled perfectly; this person is to be called the Learner
The other participant's job will be to test the Learner's memory and to deliver increasingly strong electric shocks for every mistake; this person will be designated the Teacher
Naturally, you get a bit nervous at this news
And your apprehension increases when, after drawing lots with your partner, you find that you are assigned the Learner role
You hadn't expected the possibility of pain as part of the study, so you briefly consider leaving
But no, you 158 /   think, there's plenty of time for that if need be and, besides, how strong a shock could it be? After you have had a chance to study the list of word pairs, the re searcher straps you into a chair and, with the Teacher looking on, at taches electrodes to your arm
More worried now about the effect of the shock, you inquire into its severity
The researcher's response is hardly comforting; he says that although the shocks can be extremely painful, they will cause you "no permanent tissue damage." With that, the researcher and the Teacher leave you alone and go to the next room, where the Teacher asks you the test questions through an intercom system and delivers electric punishment for every wrong response
As the test proceeds, you quickly recognize the pattern that the Teacher follows: He asks the question and waits for your answer over the intercom
Whenever you err, he announces the voltage of the shock you are about to receive and pulls a level to deliver the punishment
The most troubling thing is that with each error you make, the shock increases by 15 volts
The first part of the test progresses smoothly
The shocks are annoying but tolerable
Later on, though, as your mistakes accumulate and the shock voltages climb, the punishment begins to hurt enough to disrupt your concentration, which leads to more errors and ever more disruptive shocks
At the 75, 90, and 105volt levels, the pain makes you grunt audibly
At 120 volts, you exclaim into the intercom that the shocks are really starting to hurt
You take one more punishment with a groan and decide that you can't take much more pain
After the Teacher delivers the 150volt shock, you shout back into the intercom, "That's all! Get me out of here! Get me out of here, please! Let me out!" But instead of the assurance you expect from the Teacher that he and the researcher are coming to release you, the Teacher merely gives you the next test question to answer
Surprised and confused, you mumble the first answer to come into your head
It's wrong, of course, and the Teacher delivers a 165volt shock
You scream at the Teacher to stop, to let you out
But he responds only with the next test question — and with the next slashing shock when your frenzied answer is incorrect
You can't hold down the panic any longer; the shocks are so strong now they make you writhe and shriek
You kick the wall, demand to be released, beg the Teacher to help you
But the test questions continue as before and so do the dreaded shocks — in searing jolts of 195, 210, 225, 240, 255, 270, 285, and 300 volts
You realize that you can't possibly answer the test correctly now, so you shout to the Teacher that you won't answer his questions any longer
Nothing changes; the Teacher interprets your failure to respond as an incorrect response and sends another bolt
The ordeal continues in this way until, finally, the power   159 of the shocks stuns you into near paralysis
You can no longer cry out, no longer struggle
You can only feel each terrible electric bite
Perhaps, you think, this total inactivity will cause the Teacher to stop
There can be no reason to continue this experiment
But he proceeds relentlessly, calling out the test questions, announcing the horrid shock levels (about 400 volts now), and pulling the levers
What must this man be like? you wonder in confusion
Why doesn't he help me? Why won't he stop? For most of us, the above scenario reads like a bad dream
To recog nize how nightmarish it is, though, we should understand that in most respects it is real
There was such an experiment — actually, a whole series — run by a psychology professor named Milgram in which parti cipants in the Teacher role were willing to deliver continued, intense, and dangerous levels of shock to a kicking, screeching, pleading other person
Only one major aspect of the experiment was not genuine
No real shock was delivered; the Learner, the victim who repeatedly cried out in agony for mercy and release, was not a true subject but an actor who only pretended to be shocked
The actual purpose of Milgram's study, then, had nothing to do with the effects of punishment on learning and memory
Rather, it involved an entirely different question: When it is their job, how much suffering will ordinary people be willing to inflict on an entirely innocent other person? The answer is most unsettling
Under circumstances mirroring pre cisely the features of the "bad dream," the typical Teacher was willing to deliver as much pain as was available to give
Rather than yield to the pleas of the victim, about two thirds of the subjects in Milgram's experiment pulled every one of the thirty shock switches in front of them and continued to engage the last switch (450 volts) until the re searcher ended the experiment
More alarming still, not one of the forty subjects in this study quit his job as Teacher when the victim first began to demand his release; nor later, when he began to beg for it; nor even later, when his reaction to each shock had become, in Milgram's words, "definitely an agonized scream." Not until the 300volt shock had been sent and the victim had "shouted in desperation that he would no longer provide answers to the memory test" did anyone stop — and even then, it was a distinct minority who did
These results surprised everyone associated with the project, Milgram included
In fact, before the study began, he asked groups of colleagues, graduate students, and psychology majors at Yale University (where the experiment was performed) to read a copy of the experimental procedures and estimate how many subjects would go all the way to the last (450volt) shock
Invariably, the answers fell in the 1 to 2 percent range
A separate group of thirtynine psychiatrists predicted that only 160 /   about one person in a thousand would be willing to continue to the end
No one, then, was prepared for the behavior patterns that the ex periment actually produced
How can we explain those alarming patterns? Perhaps, as some have argued, it has to do with the fact that the subjects were all males who are known as a group for their aggressive tendencies, or that the subjects didn't recognize the potential harm that such high shock voltages could cause, or that the subjects were a freakish collection of moral cretins who enjoyed the chance to inflict misery
But there is good evidence against each of these possibilities
First, the subjects' sex was shown by a later experiment to be irrelevant to their willingness to give all the shocks to the victim; female Teachers were just as likely to do so as the males in Milgram's initial study
The explanation that subjects weren't aware of the potential physical danger to the victim was also examined in a subsequent experiment and found to be wanting
In that version, when the victim was instructed to announce that he had a heart condition and to declare that his heart was being affected by the shock — "That's all
Get me out of here
I told you I had heart trouble
My heart's starting to bother me
I refuse to go on
Let me out'' — the results were the same as before; 65 percent of the subjects carried out their duties faithfully through the maximum shock
Finally, the explanation that Milgram's subjects were a twisted, sad istic bunch not at all representative of the average citizen has proven unsatisfactory as well
The people who answered Milgram's newspaper ad to participate in his "memory" experiment represented a standard cross section of ages, occupations, and educational levels within our society
What's more, later on, a battery of personality scales showed these people to be quite normal psychologically, with not a hint of psychosis as a group
They were, in fact, just like you and me; or, as Milgram likes to term it, they are you and me
If he is right that his studies implicate us in their grisly findings, the unanswered question becomes an uncomfortably personal one: What could make us do such things? Milgram is sure he knows the answer
It has to do, he says, with a deepseated sense of duty to authority within us all
According to Mil gram, the real culprit in the experiments was his subject's inability to defy the wishes of the boss of the study — the labcoated researcher who urged and, if need be, directed the subjects to perform their duties, despite the emotional and physical mayhem they were causing
The evidence supporting Milgram's obedience to authority explana tion is strong
First, it is clear that, without the researcher's directives to continue, the subjects would have ended the experiment quickly
They hated what they were doing and agonized over their victim's   161 agony
They implored the researcher to let them stop
When he refused, they went on, but in the process they trembled, they perspired, they shook, they stammered protests and additional pleas for the victim's release
Their fingernails dug into their own flesh; they bit their lips until they bled; they held their heads in their hands; some fell into fits of uncontrollable nervous laughter
As one outside observer to the ex periment wrote: I observed a mature and initially poised businessman enter the laboratory smiling and confident
Within twenty minutes he was reduced to a twitching, stuttering wreck who was rapidly approach ing a point of nervous collapse
He constantly pulled on his earlobe and twisted his hands
At one point he pushed his fist into his forehead and muttered: "Oh, God, let's stop it." And yet he con tinued to respond to every word of the experimenter and obeyed to the end
1 In addition to these observations, Milgram has provided even more convincing evidence for the obediencetoauthority interpretation of his subjects' behavior
In a later study, for instance, he had the researcher and the victim switch scripts so that the researcher told the Teacher to stop delivering shocks to the victim, while the victim insisted bravely that the Teacher continue
The result couldn't have been clearer; 100 percent of the subjects refused to give one additional shock when it was merely the fellow subject who demanded it
The identical finding ap peared in another version of the experiment in which the researcher and fellow subject switched roles so that it was the researcher who was strapped into the chair and the fellow subject who ordered the Teacher to continue — over the protests of the researcher
Again, not one subject touched another shock lever
The extreme degree to which subjects in Milgram's situation were attentive to the wishes of authority was documented in yet another variation of the basic study
In this case, Milgram presented the Teacher with two researchers, who issued contradictory orders; one ordered the Teacher to terminate the shocks when the victim cried out for release, while the other maintained that the experiment should go on
These conflicting instructions reliably produced what may have been the project's only humor: In tragicomic befuddlement and with eyes darting from one researcher to another, subjects would beseech the pair to agree on a single command they could follow: "Wait, wait
Which is it going to be? One says stop, one says go
Which is it!?" When the researchers remained at loggerheads, the subjects tried frantically to determine who was the bigger boss
Failing this route to obedience with the authority, every subject finally followed his better instincts and 162 /   ended the shocks
As in the other experimental variations, such a result would hardly be expected had the subjects' motivations involved some form of sadism or neurotic aggressiveness
To Milgram's mind, evidence of a chilling phenomenon emerges re peatedly from his accumulated data: "It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitutes the chief finding of the study." There are sobering implica tions of this finding for those concerned about the ability of another form of authority — government — to extract frightening levels of obed ience from ordinary citizens
Furthermore, the finding tells us some thing about the sheer strength of authority pressures in controlling our behavior
After witnessing Milgram's subjects squirming and sweating and suffering at their task, could anyone doubt the power of the force that held them there? For those whose doubts remain, the story of S
Brian Willson might prove instructive
On September 1, 1987, to protest U.S
shipments of military equipment to Nicaragua, Mr
Willson and two other men stretched their bodies across the railroad tracks leading out of the Concord, California, Naval Weapons Station
The protesters were con fident that their act would halt the scheduled train's progress that day, as they had notified Navy and railroad officials of their intent three days before
But the civilian crew, which had been given orders not to stop, never even slowed the train, despite being able to see the protesters six hundred feet ahead
Although two of the men managed to scramble out of harm's way, Mr
Willson was not quick enough to avoid being struck and having both legs severed below the knee
Because Navy medical corpsmen at the scene refused to treat him or allow him to be taken to the hospital in their ambulance, onlookers — including Mr
Willson's wife and son — were left to try to stanch the flow of blood for fortyfive minutes until a private ambulance arrived
Amazingly, Mr
Willson, who served four years in Vietnam, does not blame either the crewmen or the corpsmen for his misfortune; he points his finger, instead, at a system that constrained their actions through the pressure to obey: "They were just doing what I did in 'Nam
They were following orders that are part of an insane policy
They're the fall guys." Although the crew members shared Mr
Willson's assessment of them as victims, they did not share his magnanimity
In what is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the incident, the train crew filed suit against him, requesting punitive damages for the "humiliation, mental anguish, and physical stress" they suffered because he hadn't allowed them to carry out their orders without cutting off his legs
Whenever we are faced with so potent a motivator of human action
  163 it is natural to expect that good reasons exist for the motivation
In the case of obedience to authority, even a brief consideration of human social organization offers justification aplenty
A multilayered and widely accepted system of authority confers an immense advantage upon a society
It allows the development of sophisticated structures for re source production, trade, defense, expansion, and social control that would otherwise be impossible
The other alternative, anarchy, is a state that is hardly known for its beneficial effects on cultural groups and one that the social philosopher Thomas Hobbes assures us would render life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Consequently, we are trained from birth that obedience to proper authority is right and dis obedience is wrong
The essential message fills the parental lessons, the schoolhouse rhymes, stories, and songs of our childhood and is carried forward in the legal, military, and political systems we encounter as adults
Notions of submission and loyalty to legitimate rule are ac corded much value in each
Religious instruction contributes as well
The very first book of the Bible, for example, describes how failure to obey the ultimate authority produced the loss of paradise for Adam, Eve, and the rest of the human race
Should that particular metaphor prove too subtle, just a bit further into the Old Testament we can read — in what might be the closest bib lical representation of the Milgram experiment — the respectful account of Abraham's willingness to plunge a dagger through the heart of his young son, because God, without any explanation, ordered it
We learn it this story that the correctness of an action was not adjudged by such considerations as apparent senselessness, harmfulness, injustice, or usual moral standards, but by the mere command of a higher authority
Abraham's tormented ordeal was a test of obedience, and he — like Milgram's subjects, who perhaps had learned an early lesson from him — passed
Stories like those of Abraham and Milgram's subjects can tell us much about the power of and value for obedience in our culture
In another sense, however, they may be misleading as to the way obedience typic ally occurs
We rarely agonize to such a degree over the pros and cons of authority's demands
In fact, our obedience frequently takes place in a click, whirr fashion, with little or no conscious deliberation
Inform ation from a recognized authority can provide us a valuable shortcut for deciding how to act in a situation
After all, as Milgram himself suggests, conforming to the dictates of authority figures has always had genuine practical advantages for us
Early on, these people (for example, parents, teachers) knew more than we did, and we found that taking their advice proved beneficial — partly because of their greater wisdom and partly because they controlled our 164 /   rewards and punishments
As adults, the same benefits persist for the same reasons, though the authority figures now appear as employers, judges, and government leaders
Because their positions speak of super ior access to information and power, it makes great sense to comply with the wishes of properly constituted authorities
It makes so much sense, in fact, that we often do so when it makes no sense at all
This paradox is, of course, the same one that attends all major weapons of  
In this instance, once we realize that obedience to authority is mostly rewarding, it is easy to allow ourselves the con venience of automatic obedience
The simultaneous blessing and bane of such blind obedience is its mechanical character
We don't have to think; therefore, we don't
Although such mindless obedience leads us to appropriate action in the great majority of cases, there will be con spicuous exceptions — because we are reacting rather than thinking
Let's take an example from one facet of our lives where authority pressures are visible and strong: medicine
Health is enormously im portant to us
Thus, physicians, who possess large amounts of know ledge and   in this vital area, hold the position of respected authorities
In addition, the medical establishment has a clearly terraced power and prestige structure
The various kinds of health workers well understand the level of their jobs in this structure; and they well under stand, too, that the M.D
sits at the top
No one may overrule the doctor's judgment in a case, except perhaps, another doctor of higher rank
As a consequence, a longestablished tradition of automatic obedience to a doctor's orders has developed among healthcare staffs
The worrisome possibility arises, then, that when a physician makes a clear error, no one lower in the hierarchy will think to question it — precisely because, once a legitimate authority has given an order, subordinates stop thinking in the situation and start reacting
Mix this kind of click, whirr response into a complex hospital environment and mistakes are certain
Indeed a study done in the early 1980s by the U.S
Health Care Financing Administration showed that, for patient medic ation alone, the average hospital had a 12 percent daily error rate
A decade later, things had not improved: According to a Harvard Univer sity study, 10 percent of all cardiac arrests in hospitals are attributable to medication errors
Errors in the medicine patients receive can occur for a variety of reasons
However, a book entitled Medication Errors: Causes and Prevention by two Temple University pharmacology profess ors, Michael Cohen and Neil Davis, attributes much of the problem to the mindless deference given the "boss" of the patient's case: the attend ing physician
According to Professor Cohen, "in case after case, patients, nurses, pharmacists, and other physicians do not question the prescrip tion." Take, for example, the strange case of the "rectal earache" reported   165 by Cohen and Davis
A physician ordered ear drops to be administered to the right ear of a patient suffering pain and infection there
But instead of writing out completely the location "right ear" on the prescription, the doctor abbreviated it so that the instructions read "place in R ear." Upon receiving the prescription, the duty nurse promptly put the re quired number of ear drops into the patient's anus
Obviously, rectal treatment of an earache made no sense
Yet neither the patient nor the nurse questioned it
The important lesson of this story is that in many situations where a legitimate authority has spoken, what would otherwise make sense is irrelevant
In these instances, we don't consider the situation as a whole but attend and respond to only one aspect of it
4 Wherever our behaviors are governed in such an unthinking manner, we can be confident that there will be compliance professionals trying to take advantage
We can stay within the field of medicine and see that advertisers have frequently harnessed the respect accorded to doctors in our culture by hiring actors to play the roles of doctors speaking on behalf of the product
My favorite example is a TV commercial featuring actor Robert Young counseling people against the dangers of caffeine and recommending caffeinefree Sanka Brand coffee
The commercial was highly successful, selling so much coffee that it was played for years in several versions
But why should this commercial prove so ef fective? Why on earth would we take Robert Young's word for the health consequences of decaffeinated coffee? Because — as the advertising agency that hired him knew perfectly well — he is associated in the minds of the American public with Marcus Welby, M.D., the role he played in an earlier longrunning television series
Objectively it doesn't make sense to be swayed by the comments of a man we know to be just an actor who used to play a doctor
But, as a practical matter, that man moved the Sanka
CONNOTATION, NOT CONTENT From the first time I saw it, the most intriguing feature for me in the Robert Young Sanka commercial was its ability to use the   of the authority principle without ever providing a real authority
The appearance of authority was enough
This tells us something important about unthinking reactions to authority figures
When in a click, whirr mode, we are often as vulnerable to the symbols of authority as to the substance
There are several kinds of symbols that can reliably trigger our com pliance in the absence of the genuine substance of authority
Con sequently, they are employed extensively by those compliance profes 166 /   sionals who are short on substance
Con artists, for example, drape themselves with the titles, clothes, and trappings of authority
They love nothing more than to emerge elegantly dressed from a fine auto mobile and to introduce themselves to their prospective "mark" as Doctor or Judge or Professor or Commissioner Someone
They under stand that when they are so equipped, their chances for compliance are greatly increased
Each of these three types of symbols of authority has its own story and is worth a separate look
Titles Titles are simultaneously the most difficult and the easiest symbols of authority to acquire
To earn one normally takes years of work and achievement
Yet it is possible for somebody who has put in none of this effort to adopt the mere label and receive a kind of automatic defer ence
As we have seen, TVcommercial actors and con artists do it suc cessfully all the time
I recently talked with a friend — a faculty member at a wellknown eastern university — who provided a telling illustration of how our ac tions are frequently more  d by a title than by the nature of the person claiming it
My friend travels quite a bit and often finds himself chatting with strangers in bars, restaurants, and airports
He says that he has learned through much experience never to use his title — profess or — during these conversations
When he does, he reports, the tenor of the interaction changes immediately
People who have been spontaneous and interesting conversation partners for the prior half hour become respectful, accepting, and dull
His opinions that earlier might have produced a lively exchange now usually generate extended (and highly grammatical) statements of accord
Annoyed and slightly bewildered by the phenomenon — because, as he says, "I'm still the same guy they've been talking to for the past thirty minutes, right?" — my friend now regularly lies about his occupation in such situations
What a refreshing shift from the more typical pattern in which certain compliance practitioners lie about titles they don't truly have
In either direction, however, such practiced dishonesty makes the same point about the sufficiency of a mere symbol of authority to   behavi or
I wonder whether my professor friend — who is physically somewhat short — would be so eager to hide his title if he knew that, besides making strangers more accommodating, it also makes them see him as taller
Studies investigating the way in which authority status affects perceptions of size have found that prestigious titles lead to height distortions
In one experiment conducted on five classes of Australian   167 college students, a man was introduced as a visitor from Cambridge University in England
However, his status at Cambridge was repres ented differently in each of the classes
To one class, he was presented as a student; to a second class, a demonstrator; to another, a lecturer; to yet another, a senior lecturer; to a fifth, a professor
After he left the room, each class was asked to estimate his height
It was found that with each increase in status, the same man grew in perceived height by an average of a half inch, so that as the "professor" he was seen as two and a half inches taller than as the "student." It is worth the time of a small detour to pursue this interesting con nection between status and perceived size, since it shows up in a variety of ways
In judging the size of coins, for example, children most overes timate the size of the more valuable coins
And adults are just as guilty of such distortions
In one study, college students drew cards that had monetary values printed on them ranging from $3.00 to $3.00; they won or lost the amount shown on the cards they picked
Afterward, they were asked to rate the size of each card
Even though all cards were exactly the same size, those that had the more extreme values — pos itive or negative — were seen as physically larger
Thus it is not neces sarily the pleasantness of a thing that makes it seem bigger to us, it is its importance
Because we see size and status as related, it is possible for certain in dividuals to benefit by substituting the former for the latter
In some animal societies, where the status of a male is assigned on the basis of dominance, size is an important factor in determining which male will achieve which status level in the group/ Usually, in combat with a rival, the larger and more powerful male wins
To avoid the harmful effects to the group of such physical conflict, however, many species have adopted methods that frequently involve more form than fracas
The two males confront each other with showy aggression displays that invariably include sizeenhancing tricks
Various mammals arch their backs and bristle their coats; fish extend their fins and puff themselves up with water; birds unfurl and flutter their wings
Very often, this ex hibition alone is enough to send one of the histrionic warriors into re treat, leaving the contested status position to his seemingly larger and stronger rival
Fur, fins, and feathers
Isn't it interesting how these most delicate of parts can be exploited to give the impression of substance and weight? There are two lessons for us here
One is specific to the association between size and status
The connection of those two things can be profitably employed by individuals who are able to fake the first to gain the appearance of the second
This is precisely why con men, even 168 /   those of average or slightly aboveaverage height, commonly wear lifts in their shoes
The other lesson is more general: The outward signs of power and authority frequently may be counterfeited with the flimsiest of materials
Let's return to the realm of titles for an example — an example that in volves what, in several ways, is the scariest experiment I know
A group of researchers, composed of doctors and nurses with connections to three midwestern hospitals, became increasingly concerned with the extent of mechanical obedience to doctors' orders on the part of nurses
It seemed to the researchers that even highly trained and skilled nurses were not using that training or skill sufficiently to check on a doctor's judgment; instead, when confronted with a physician's directives, they would simply defer
Earlier, we saw how this process accounted for the case of the rectally administered ear drops
But the midwestern researchers took things several steps further
First, they wanted to find out whether such cases were isolated incidents or representative of a widespread phenomenon
Second, they wanted to examine the problem in the context of a serious treatment error — the gross overprescription of an unauthorized drug to a hospital patient
Finally, they wanted to see what would happen if they physically removed the authority figure from the situation and substituted an unfamiliar voice on the phone, offering only the frailest evidence of authority — the claimed title "doctor." To twentytwo separate nurses' stations on various surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric wards, one of the researchers made an identical phone call in which he identified himself as a hospital physician and directed the answering nurse to give twenty milligrams of a drug (Astrogen) to a specific ward patient
There were four excellent reasons for a nurse's caution in response to this order: (1) The prescription was transmitted by phone, in direct violation of hospital policy
(2) The medication itself was unauthorized; Astrogen had not been cleared for use nor placed on the ward stock list
(3) The prescribed dosage was obviously and dangerously excessive
The medication containers clearly stated that the "maximum daily dose" was only ten milligrams, half of what had been ordered
(4) The directive was given by a man the nurse had never met, seen, or even talked with before on the phone
Yet, in 95 percent of the instances, the nurses went straightaway to the ward medicine cabinet, where they secured the ordered dosage of Astrogen and started for the patient's room to administer it
It was at this point that they were stopped by a secret observer, who revealed the nature of the experiment
The results are frightening, indeed
That 95 percent of regular staff nurses complied unhesitatingly with a patently improper instruction   169 of this sort must give us all great reason for concern as potential hospital patients
Given the recent U.S
Health Care Financing Administration estimate of a 12 percent dailymedication error rate in American hospit als, stays of longer than a week make it likely that we will be recipients of such an error
What the midwestern study shows is that the mistakes are hardly limited to trivial slips in the administration of harmless ear drops or the like, but extend to grave and dangerous blunders
In interpreting their unsettling findings, the researchers came to an instructive conclusion: In a reallife situation corresponding to the experimental one, there would, in theory, be two professional intelligences, the doctor's and the nurse's, working to ensure that a given procedure be un dertaken in a manner beneficial to the patient or, at the very least, not detrimental to him
The experiment strongly suggests, how ever, that one of these intelligences is, for all practical purposes, nonfunctioning
It seems that, in the face of a physician's directives, the nurses un hooked their "professional intelligences" and moved to a click, whirr form of responding
None of their considerable medical training or knowledge was engaged in the decision of what to do
Instead, because obedience to legitimate authority had always been the most preferred and efficient action in their work setting, they had become willing to err on the side of automatic obedience
It is all the more instructive that they had traveled so far in this direction that their error had come not in response to genuine authority but to its most easily falsified sym bol — a bare title
Clothes A second kind of authority symbol that can trigger our mechanical compliance is clothing
Though more tangible than a title, the cloak of authority is every bit as fakable
Police bunco files bulge with records of con artists whose artistry includes the quick change
In chameleon style, they adopt the hospital white, priestly black, army green, or police blue that the situation requires for maximum advantage
Only too late do their victims realize that the garb of authority is hardly its guarantee
A series of studies by social psychologist Leonard Bickman gives an indication of how difficult it can be to resist requests that come from figures in authority attire
Bickman's basic procedure was to ask pass ersby on the street to comply with some sort of odd request (to pick up a discarded paper bag, to stand on the other side of a busstop sign)
In half of the instances, the requester — a young man — was dressed in 170 /   normal street clothes; the rest of the time, he was dressed in a security guard's uniform
Regardless of the type of request, many more people obeyed the requester when he wore the guard costume
Especially revealing was one version of the experiment in which the requester stopped pedestrians and pointed to a man standing by a parking meter fifty feet away
The requester, whether dressed normally or as a security guard, always said the same thing to the pedestrian: "You see that guy over there by the meter? He's overparked but doesn't have any change
Give him a dime!" The requester then turned a corner and walked away so that by the time the pedestrian reached the meter, the requester was out of sight
The power of his uniform lasted, how ever, even after he was long gone: Nearly all the pedestrians complied with his directive when he had worn the guard costume, but fewer than half did so when he had dressed normally
It is interesting to note that later on, Bickman found college students able to guess with considerable accuracy the percentage of compliance that had occurred in the experi ment when the requester wore street clothes (50 percent vs
the actual 42 percent); yet the students greatly underestimated the percentage of compliance when he was in uniform (63 percent vs
the actual 92 per cent)
10 Less blatant in its connotation than a uniform, but nonetheless effect ive, is another kind of attire that has traditionally bespoken authority status in our culture: the welltailored business suit
It, too, can evoke a telling form of deference from total strangers
Research conducted in Texas, for instance, arranged for a thirtyoneyearold man to violate the law by crossing the street against the traffic light on a variety of occasions
In half of the cases, he was dressed in a freshly pressed business suit and tie; on the other occasions, he wore a work shirt and trousers
The researchers watched from a distance and counted the number of pedestrians waiting at the corner who followed the man across the street
Like the children of Hamelin who crowded after the Pied Piper, three and a half times as many people swept into traffic behind the suited jaywalker
In this case, though, the magic came not from his pipe but his pinstripes
1 It is noteworthy that the two types of authority apparel shown by the above research to be influential — the guard uniform and business suit — are combined deftly by confidence men in a fraud called the bank examiner scheme
The target of the swindle can be anyone, but elderly persons living alone are preferred
The con begins when a man dressed in a properly conservative threepiece business suit appears at the door of a likely victim
Everything about his clothing sends a message of propriety and respectability
The white shirt is starched; the wingtip shoes glow deeply
His suit is not trendy but classic: The lapels are three   171 inches wide — no more, no less; the cloth is heavy and substantial, even in July; the tones are muted, business blue, business gray, business black
He explains to his intended victim — perhaps a widow he secretly followed home from the bank a day or two earlier — that he is a profes sional bank examiner who, in the course of auditing the books of her bank, has found some seeming irregularities
He thinks he has spotted the culprit, a bank officer who is regularly doctoring reports of transac tions in certain accounts
He says that the widow's account may be one of these, but he can't be sure until he has hard evidence
Therefore, he has come to ask for her cooperation
Would she help out by withdrawing her savings so a team of examiners and responsible bank officials can trace the record of the transaction as it passes across the suspect's desk? Often the appearance and presentation of the "bank examiner" are so impressive that the victim never thinks to check on their validity with even a simple phone call
Instead, she drives to the bank, with draws all her money, and returns home with it to wait with the "exam iner" for word on the success of the trap
When the message comes, it is delivered by a uniformed bank guard, who arrives after closing hours to announce that all is well — apparently the widow's account was not one of those being tampered with
Greatly relieved, the "examiner" offers gracious thanks and, since the bank is now conveniently closed, instructs the guard to return the lady's money to the vault, to save her the trouble of doing so the next day
With smiles and handshakes all around, the guard takes the funds and leaves the "examiner" to express a few more minutes of thanks before he, too, exits
Naturally, as the victim eventually discovers, the "guard" is no more a guard than the "examiner" is an examiner
What they are is a pair of bunco artists who have recognized the capacity of carefully counterfeited uniforms to click us into mesmerized compliance with "authority." Trappings Aside from its function in uniforms, clothing can symbolize a more generalized type of authority when it serves an ornamental purpose
Finely styled and expensive clothes carry an aura of status and position, as do trappings such as jewelry and cars
The last of these status symbols is particularly interesting in the United States, where "the American love affair with the automobile" gives it unusual significance
According to the findings of a study done in the San Francisco Bay area, owners of prestige autos receive a special kind of deference from us
The experimenters discovered that motorists would wait significantly longer before honking their horns at a new, luxury car stopped in front 172 /   of a green traffic light than at an older, economy model
The motorists had little patience with the economycar driver: Nearly ah sounded their horns, and the majority of these did so more than once; two simply rammed into his rear bumper
So intimidating was the aura of the prestige automobile, however, that 50 percent of the motorists waited respectfully behind it, never touching their horns, until it drove on
1 Later on, the researchers asked college students what they would have done in such situations
Compared to the true findings of the ex periment, the students consistently underestimated the time it would take them to honk at the luxury car
The male students were especially inaccurate, feeling that they would honk faster at the prestige than the economycar driver; of course, the study itself showed just the opposite
Note the similarity of this pattern to much other research on authority pressures
As in Milgram's research, the midwestern hospitalnurses' study, and the securityguarduniform experiment, people were unable to predict correctly how they or others would react to authority influ ence
In each instance, the effect of such   was grossly underes timated
This property of authority status may account for much of its success as a compliance device
Not only does it work forcefully on us, but it also does so unexpectedly
HOW TO SAY NO One protective tactic we can use against authority status is to remove its element of surprise
Because we typically misperceive the profound impact of authority (and its symbols) on our actions, we are at the dis advantage of being insufficiently cautious about its presence in compli ance situations
A fundamental form of defense against this problem, therefore, is a heightened awareness of authority power
When this awareness is coupled with a recognition of how easily authority symbols can be faked, the benefit will be a properly guarded approach to situ ations involving authority  attempts
Sounds simple, right? And in a way it is
A better understanding of the workings of authority   should help us resist it
Yet there is a perverse complication — the familiar one inherent in ah weapons of  : We shouldn't want to resist altogether, or even most of the time
Generally, authority figures know what they are talking about
Physicians, judges, corporate executives, legislative leaders, and the like have typically gained their positions because of superior knowledge and judgment
Thus, as a rule, their directives offer excellent counsel
The trick is to be able to recognize without much strain or vigilance when authority promptings are best followed and when they should be resisted
  173 Posing two questions to ourselves can help enormously to accomplish this trick
The first is to ask, when we are confronted with what appears to be an authority figure's   attempt, "Is this authority truly an expert?" The question is helpful because it focuses our attention on a pair of crucial pieces of information: the authority's credentials and the relevance of those credentials to the topic at hand
By orienting in this simple way toward the evidence for authority status, we can avoid the major pitfalls of automatic deference
An illustration or two is in order
Let's examine the highly successful Robert Young Sankacoffee commercial in this light
If, rather than responding to his "Marcus Welby, M.D." association, people had focused on Mr
Young's actual status as an authority, I am confident that the commercial would not have had so long and productive a run
Obviously, Robert Young does not possess a physician's training or knowledge
We all know that
What he does possess, however, is a physician's title, "M.D." Now, clearly, it is an empty title, connected to him in our minds through the device of playacting
We all know that, too
But isn't it fascinating how, when we are whirring along, what is obvious often doesn't matter unless we pay specific attention to it? That is why the "Is this authority truly an expert?" question can be so valuable: It brings our attention to the obvious
It channels us effort lessly away from a focus on possibly meaningless symbols to a consid eration of genuine authority credentials
What's more, the question impels us to distinguish between relevant authorities and irrelevant authorities
And this is a distinction that is easy to forget when the push of authority pressure is combined with the rush of modern life
The Texas pedestrians who bustled into city traffic behind a businesssuited jaywalker offer a prime example
Even if the man had been the business authority his clothes suggested he might be, he was unlikely to be a greater authority on crossing the street than other people, including those who followed him into traffic
Still, they did follow, as if his label, "authority," overwhelmed the vital difference between relevant and irrelevant forms
Had they bothered to ask themselves whether he represented a true expert in the situation, someone whose actions reflected superior knowledge there, I expect the result would have been quite different
The same process applies to Robert Young, a man who is not without expertise
He has fashioned a long career with many achievements in a difficult business
But his skills and knowledge are as an actor, not a doctor
When, in viewing the famous coffee commercial, we focus on his true credentials, we will realize quickly that he should be no more believed than any other successful actor who claims that Sanka is healthy
174 /   Suppose, though, we are confronted with an authority we determine is a relevant expert
Before submitting to authority  , it would be wise to ask a second simple question: "How truthful can we expect the expert to be here?" Authorities, even the best informed, may not present their information honestly to us
Therefore we need to consider their trustworthiness in the situation
In fact, most of the time, we do
We allow ourselves to be much more swayed by experts who seem to be impartial than by those who have something to gain by convincing us; and this has been shown by research to be true around the world
1 By wondering how an expert stands to benefit from our compliance, we give ourselves another safety net against undue and automatic in fluence
Even knowledgeable authorities in a field will not persuade us until we are satisfied that their messages represent the facts faithfully
When asking ourselves about such a person's trustworthiness, we should keep in mind a little tactic compliance practitioners often use to assure us of their sincerity: They will seem to argue to a degree against their own interests
Correctly done, this can be a subtly effective device for proving their honesty
Perhaps they will mention a small shortcom ing in their position or product ("Oh, the disadvantages of Benson & Hedges")
Invariably, though, the drawback will be a secondary one that is easily overcome by more significant advantages — "Listerine, the taste you hate three times a day"; "Avis: We're number two, but we try harder"; "L'Oreal, a bit more expensive and worth it." By establishing their basic truthfulness on minor issues, the compliance professionals who use this ploy can then be more believable when stressing the im portant aspects of their argument
1 I have seen this approach used with devastating effect in a place that few of us recognize as a compliance setting: the restaurant
It is no secret that because of shamelessly low wages, servers in restaurants must supplement their earnings with tips
Leaving the sine qua non of good service aside, the most successful waiters and waitresses know certain tricks for increasing tips
They also know that the larger a customer's bill, the larger the amount of money likely to come to them in a standard gratuity
In these two regards, then — building the size of the customer's charge and building the percentage of that charge that is given as a tip — servers regularly act as compliance agents
Hoping to find out how they operate, I applied for waiter openings at several fairly expensive restaurants
Without experience, though, the best I could do was to land a busboy job that, as things turned out, provided me a propitious vantage point from which to watch and analyze the action
Before long, I realized what the other employees already knew — that the most successful waiter in the place was Vincent,   175 who somehow arranged for patrons to order more and tip higher than for anyone else; in fact, the other servers were not even close to him in weekly earnings
So I began to linger in my duties around Vincent's tables to observe his style
I quickly learned that his style was to have no single style
He had a repertoire of them, each ready to be called on under the appropri ate circumstances
When the customers were a family, he was efferves cent — even slightly clownish — directing his remarks as often to the children as to the adults
With a young couple on a date, he became formal and a bit imperious in an attempt to intimidate the young man (to whom he spoke exclusively) into ordering and tipping lavishly
With an older, married couple, he retained the formality but dropped the superior air in favor of a respectful orientation to both members of the couple
Should the patron be dining alone, Vincent selected a friendly demeanor — cordial, conversational, and warm
But Vincent reserved the trick of seeming to argue against his own interests for large parties of eight to twelve people
Here his technique was veined with genius
When it was time for the first person, normally a lady, to order, he went into his act
No matter what she selected, Vincent reacted identically: His brow furrowed, his hand hovered above his order pad, and after looking quickly over his shoulder for the manager, he leaned conspiratorially toward the table to report for all to hear, "I'm afraid that is not as good tonight as it normally is
Might I recommend instead the or the ?" (Here Vincent suggested a pair of menu items that were fifty cents or so less expensive than the dish the patron had selected initially.) "They are both excellent tonight." With this single maneuver, Vincent engaged several important prin ciples of  
First, even those who did not take his suggestions felt that Vincent had done them a favor by offering valuable information to help them order
Everyone felt grateful, and consequently the rule for reciprocity would work in his favor when it came time to decide on his gratuity
But besides hiking the percentage of his tip, Vincent's maneuver also placed him in a favorable position to increase the size of the table's order
It established him as an authority on the current stores of the house; he clearly knew what was and wasn't good that night
Moreover — and this is where seeming to argue against his own interests came in — it proved him to be a trustworthy informant, because he recommended dishes that were slightly less expensive than originally ordered
Rather than trying to line his own pockets, he seemed to have the customers' best interests at heart
To all appearances, he was at once knowledgeable and honest, a combination that gave him great credibility
And Vincent was quick to exploit the advantage of this credible image
When the party had fin 176 /   ished giving their food orders, he would say, "Very well, and would you like me to suggest or select some wine to go with your meals?" As I watched the scene repeated almost nightly, there was a notable con sistency to the customers' reactions — smiles, nods, and for the most part, general assent
Even from the distance of my vantage point, one could read their thoughts from their faces
"Sure," they seemed to say, "you know what's good here, and you're obviously on our side
Tell us what to get." Looking pleased, Vincent, who did know his vintages, would respond with some excellent (and costly) choices
He was similarly persuasive when it came time for dessert decisions
Patrons who otherwise would have passed up the dessert course or shared with a friend were swayed to partake fully by Vincent's rapturous descriptions of the Baked Alaska and chocolate mousse
Who, after all, is more believable than a demon strated expert of proven sincerity? By combining the factors of reciprocity and credible authority into a single, elegant maneuver, Vincent was able to inflate substantially both the percentage of his tip and the base charge on which it was figured
His proceeds from this trick were handsome, indeed
But notice that much of his profit came from an apparent lack of concern for personal profit
Seeming to argue against his financial interests served those in terests extremely well
READER'S REPORT From a Young Businessman "About two years ago, I was trying to sell my old car because I'd already bought a new one
One day I passed a usedcar lot with a sign reading, WE WILL SELL YOUR CAR FOR MORE
Just what I wanted, I thought; so I stopped in to talk with the owner
I told him I wanted to get about three thousand dollars for my old car, and he said he thought I should be asking for a lot more because it was worth at least thirtyfivehundred dollars
This came as a real surprise to me, because the way their con signment system worked, the larger my asking price for the car, the less money was left over for them to keep after they sold it to somebody
Therefore, by telling me to ask for more than three thousand dollars, they were cutting off their own profits
Just like your Vincentthewaiter example, they were seeming to argue against their own interests so I'd see them as trustworthy authorities; but I didn't realize this until much later
Anyway, I went along with the owner's idea that my car was worth more than I'd first thought, and I set my asking price at thirty fivehundred dollars
"After they'd had my car on their lot for a couple of days, they called   177 saying that someone was really interested in it, but that the price was a little too high
Would I be willing to drop my price by two hundred dollars to sell the car? Convinced that they had my interests at heart, I agreed
The next day they called back to say the the buyer's financing had fallen through and that he couldn't buy the car
In the next two weeks, I got two more calls from the dealership, each asking me to drop my price two hundred dollars to seal a sale to some customer
Both times I OK'd it because I still believed they were trustworthy
But each time, the alleged deal fell through
I was suspicious enough to call a friend whose family was in the car business
He said this was an old trick designed to get sellers like me to reduce their asking prices to super low levels, giving the dealership big profits when they finally sold the car
"So, I went over there and took my car
As I was leaving, they were still trying to persuade me to let them keep it because they had a 'hot prospect' who they were sure would buy it if I'd only knock off another two hundred dollars." Once again in a Reader's Report we can see the   of the contrast principle combining with the principle of primary interest
In this case, after the thirtyfivehundreddollar figure was set, each twohundreddollar nick seemed small by comparison
Chapter 7 SCARCITY The Rule of the Few The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost
— G
K
Chesterton T HE CITY OF MESA, ARIZONA, IS A SUBURB IN THE PHOENIX AREA where I live
Perhaps the most notable features of Mesa are its sizable Mormon population — next to that of Salt Lake City, the largest in the world — and a huge Mormon temple located on exquisitely kept grounds in the center of the city
Although I had appreciated the landscaping and architecture from a distance, I had never been interested enough in the temple to go inside until the day I read a newspaper article that told of a special inner sector of Mormon temples to which no one has access but faithful members of the Church
Even potential converts must not see it
There is one exception to the rule, however
For a few days immediately after a temple is newly constructed, nonmembers are allowed to tour the entire structure, including the otherwise restric ted section
The newspaper story reported that the Mesa temple had recently been refurbished and that the renovations had been extensive enough to classify it as "new" by Church standards
Thus, for the next several days only, nonMormon visitors could see the temple area traditionally banned to them
I remember quite well the effect of the article on me: I immediately resolved to take a tour
But when I phoned a friend to ask if he wanted to come along, I came to understand something that changed my decision just as quickly
After declining the invitation, my friend wondered why I seemed so   179 intent on a visit
I was forced to admit that, no, I had never been inclined toward the idea of a temple tour before, that I had no questions about the Mormon religion I wanted answered, that I had no general interest in the architecture of houses of worship, and that I expected to find nothing more spectacular or stirring than I might see at a number of other temples, churches, or cathedrals in the area
It became clear as I spoke that the special lure of the temple had a sole cause: If I did not experience the restricted sector shortly, I would never again have the chance
Something that, on its own merits, held little appeal for me had become decidedly more attractive merely because it would soon become unavailable
Since that encounter with the scarcity principle — that opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited — I have begun to notice its   over a whole range of my actions
For in stance, I routinely will interrupt an interesting facetoface conversation to answer the ring of an unknown caller
In such a situation, the caller has a compelling feature that my facetoface partner does not: potential unavailability
If I don't take the call, I might miss it (and the information it carries) for good
Never mind that the ongoing conversation may be highly engaging or important — much more than I could reasonably expect an average phone call to be
With each unanswered ring, the phone interaction becomes less retrievable
For that reason and for that moment, I want it more than the other
The idea of potential loss plays a large role in human decision making
In fact, people seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value
For instance, homeowners told how much money they could lose from inadequate insulation are more likely to insulate their homes than those told how much money they could save
Similar results have been ob tained by health researchers: Pamphlets urging young women to check for breast cancer through selfexaminations are significantly more suc cessful if they state their case in terms of what stands to be lost (e.g., "You can lose several potential health benefits by failing to spend only five minutes each month doing breast selfexamination") rather than gained (e.g., "You can gain several potential health benefits by spending only five minutes each month doing breast selfexamination")
1 Collectors of everything from baseball cards to antiques are keenly aware of the   of the scarcity principle in determining the worth of an item
As a rule, if it is rare or becoming rare, it is more valuable
Especially enlightening as to the importance of scarcity in the collectibles market is the phenomenon of the "precious mistake." Flawed items — a blurred stamp or a doublestruck coin — are sometimes the most valued 180 /   of all
Thus a stamp carrying a threeeyed likeness of George Washington is anatomically incorrect, aesthetically unappealing, and yet highly sought after
There is instructive irony here: Imperfections that would otherwise make for rubbish make for prized possessions when they bring along an abiding scarcity
With the scarcity principle operating so powerfully on the worth we assign things, it is natural that compliance professionals will do some related operating of their own
Probably the most straightforward use of the scarcity principle occurs in the "limitednumber" tactic, when the customer is informed that a certain product is in short supply that cannot be guaranteed to last long
During the time I was researching compliance strategies by infiltrating various organizations, I saw the limitednumber tactic employed repeatedly in a range of situations: "There aren't more than five convertibles with this engine left in the state
And when they're gone, that's it, 'cause we're not making 'em anymore." "This is one of only two unsold corner lots in the entire de velopment
You wouldn't want the other one; it's got a nasty eastwest exposure." "You may want to think seriously about buying more than one case today because production is backed way up and there's no telling when we'll get any more in." Sometimes the limitednumber information was true, sometimes it was wholly false
But in each instance, the intent was to convince cus tomers of an item's scarcity and thereby increase its immediate value in their eyes
I admit to developing a grudging admiration for the practitioners who made this simple device work in a multitude of ways and styles
I was most impressed, however, with a particular version that extended the basic approach to its logical extreme by selling a piece of merchandise at its scarcest point — when it seemingly could no longer be had
The tactic was played to perfection in one appliance store I in vestigated, where 30 to 50 percent of the stock was regularly listed as on sale
Suppose a couple in the store seemed from a distance to be moderately interested in a certain sale item
There are all sorts of cues that tip off such interest — closerthannormal examination of the appli ance, a casual look at any instruction booklets associated with the ap pliance, discussions held in front of the appliance, but no attempt to seek out a salesperson for further information
After observing the couple so engaged, a salesperson might approach and say, "I see you're interested in this model here, and I can understand why; it's a great machine at a great price
But, unfortunately, I sold it to another couple not more than twenty minutes ago
And, if I'm not mistaken, it was the last one we had." The customers' disappointment registers unmistakably
Because of its lost availability, the appliance jumps suddenly in attractiveness
  181 Typically, one of the customers asks if there is any chance that an unsold model still exists in the store's back room, warehouse, or other location
"Well," the salesperson allows, "that is possible, and I'd be willing to check
But do I understand that this is the model you want and if I can get it for you at this price, you'll take it?" Therein lies the beauty of the technique
In accord with the scarcity principle, the customers are asked to commit to buying the appliance when it looks least available — and therefore most desirable
Many customers do agree to a purchase at this singularly vulnerable time
Thus, when the salesperson (invariably) returns with the news that an additional supply of the appliance has been found, it is also with a pen and sales contract in hand
The inform ation that the desired model is in good supply may actually make some customers find it less attractive again
2 But by then, the business trans action has progressed too far for most people to renege
The purchase decision made and committed to publicly at an earlier, crucial point still holds
They buy
Related to the limitednumber technique is the "deadline" tactic, in which some official time limit is placed on the customer's opportunity to get what the compliance professional is offering
Much like my ex perience with the Mormon temple's inner sanctum, people frequently find themselves doing what they wouldn't particularly care to do simply because the time to do so is shrinking
The adept merchandiser makes this tendency pay off by arranging and publicizing customer dead lines — witness the collage of such newspaper ads in Figure 73 — that generate interest where none may have existed before
Concentrated instances of this approach often occur in movie advertising
In fact, I recently noticed that one theater owner, with remarkable singleness of purpose, had managed to invoke the scarcity principle three separate times in just five words that read, "Exclusive, limited engagement ends soon!" Swindled By Peter Kerr New York Times NEW YORK — Daniel Gulban doesn't remember how his life savings disap peared
He remembers the smooth voice of a salesman on the telephone
He remembers dreaming of a fortune in oil and silver futures
But to this day, the 81yearold retired utility worker does not understand how swindlers convinced him to part with $18,000
“\ just wanted to better my life in my waning days," said Gulban, a resident of 182 /   Holder, Fla
"But when I found out the truth, I couldn't eat or sleep
I lost 30 pounds
I still can't believe I would do anything like that." Gulban was the victim of a what law enforcement officials call a "boilerroom operation," a ruse that often involves dozens of fasttalking telephone salesmen crammed into a small room where they call thousands of customers each day
The companies snare hundreds of millions of dollars each year from unsuspecting customers, according to a U.S
Senate subcommittee on investigations, which issued a report on the subject last year
"They use an impressive Wall Street address, lies and deception to get individuals to sink their money into various glamoroussounding schemes," said Robert Abrams, the New York State attorney general, who has pursued more than a dozen boiler room cases in the past four years
"The victims are sometimes persuaded to invest the savings of a lifetime." Orestes J
Mihaly, the New York assistant attorney general in charge of the bureau of investor protection and securities, said the companies often operate in three stages
First, Mihaly said, comes the "opening call," in which a salesman identifies himself as representing a company with an impressivesounding name and address
He will simply ask the potential customer to receive the company's literature
A second call involves a sales pitch, Mihaly said
The salesman first describes the great profits to be made and then tells the customer that it is no longer possible to invest
The third call gives the customer a chance to get in on the deal, he said, and is offered with a great deal of urgency
"The idea is to dangle a carrot in front of the buyer's face and then take it away," Mihaly said
"The aim is to get someone to want to buy quickly, without thinking too much about it." Sometimes, Mihaly said, the salesman will be out of breath on the third call and will tell the customer that he "just came off the trading floor." Such tactics convinced Gulban to part with his life savings
In 1979, a stranger called him repeatedly and convinced Gulban to wire $1,756 to New York to purchase silver, Gulban said
After another series of telephone calls the salesman cajoled Gulban into wiring more than $6,000 for crude oil
He eventually wired an addi tional $9,740, but his profits never arrived
"My heart sank," Gulban recalled
"I was not greedy
I just hoped I would see better days." Gulban never recouped his losses

(PETER KERR, THE NEW YORK TIMES) A variant of the deadline tactic is much favored by some facetoface
  183 highpressure sellers because it carries the purest form of decision deadline: right now
Customers are often told that unless they make an immediate decision to buy, they will have to purchase the item at a higher price or they will be unable to purchase it at all
A prospective healthclub member or automobile buyer might learn that the deal offered by the salesperson is good only for that one time; should the customer leave the premises, the deal is off
One large childportrait photography company urges parents to buy as many poses and copies as they can afford because "stocking limitations force us to burn the unsold pictures of your children within twentyfour hours." A doorto door magazine solicitor might say that salespeople are in the customer's area for just a day; after that, they — and the customer's chance to buy their magazine package — will be long gone
A home vacuumcleaner operation I infiltrated instructed its sales trainees to claim, "I have so many other people to see that I have the time to visit a family only once
It's company policy that even if you decide later that you want this machine, I can't come back and sell it to you." This, of course, is non sense; the company and its representatives are in the business of making sales, and any customer who called for another visit would be accom modated gladly
As the company sales manager impressed on his trainees, the true purpose of the can'tcomeback claim has nothing to do with reducing overburdened sales schedules
It is to "keep the pro spects from taking the time to think the deal over by scaring them into believing they can't have it later, which makes them want it now." PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTANCE The evidence, then, is clear
Compliance practitioners' reliance on scarcity as a weapon of   is frequent, wideranging, systematic, and diverse
Whenever such is the case with a weapon of  , we can feel assured that the principle involved has notable power in direct ing human action
In the instance of the scarcity principle, that power comes from two major sources
The first is familiar
Like the other weapons of  , the scarcity principle trades on our weakness for shortcuts
The weakness is, as before, an enlightened one
In this case, because we know that the things that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to possess, we can often use an item's availability to help us quickly and correctly decide on its quality
Thus, one reason for the potency of the scarcity principle is that, by following it, we are usually and efficiently right
184 /   ^> 0 ' iWB'/// ESQUIRES ONE DOLLAR MEN S HAIRPIECE SALE 2 DAYS ONI v» FIGURE 73 Don't Wait! Last chance to read this now before yon turn the page (ROBERT B
CIALDINI ) In addition, there is a unique, secondary source of power within the scarcity principle: As opportunities become less available, we lose freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have
This desire to preserve our established prerogatives is the centerpiece of psycholo gical reactance theory, developed by psychologist Jack Brehm to explain the human response to diminishing personal control
According to the theory, whenever free choice is limited or threatened, the need to retain our freedoms makes us desire them (as well as the goods and services associated with them) significantly more than previously
So when in creasing scarcity — or anything else — interferes with our prior access to some item, we will react against the interference by wanting and trying to possess the item more than before
As simple as the kernel of the theory seems, its shoots and roots curl extensively through much of the social environment
From the garden of young love to the jungle of armed revolution to the fruits of the marketplace, impressive amounts of our behavior can be explained by examining for the tendrils of psychological reactance
Before beginning   185 such an examination, though, it would be helpful to know when people first show the desire to fight against restrictions of their freedoms
Child psychologists have traced the tendency back to the start of the third year of life — a year independently identified as a problem by parents and widely known to them as "the terrible twos." Most parents can attest to the development of a decidedly more contrary style in their children around this period
Twoyearolds seem masters of the art of resistance to outside, especially parental, pressure: Tell them one thing, they do the opposite; give them one toy, they want another; pick them up against their will, they wriggle and squirm to be put down; put them down against their will, they claw and struggle to be carried
One Virginiabased study nicely captured the terrible twos style among boys who averaged twentyfour months in age
The boys accom panied their mothers into a room containing two equally attractive toys
The toys were always arranged so that one stood next to a transparent Plexiglas barrier and the other stood behind the barrier
For some of the boys, the Plexiglas sheet was only a foot tall — forming no real bar rier to the toy behind, since the boys could easily reach over the top
For the other boys, however, the Plexiglas was two feet tall, effectively blocking the boys' access to one toy unless they went around the barrier
The researchers wanted to see how quickly the toddlers would make contact with the toys under these conditions
Their findings were clear
When the barrier was too small to restrict access to the toy behind it, the boys showed no special preference for either of the toys; on the av erage, the toy next to the barrier was touched just as quickly as the one behind
But when the barrier was big enough to be a true obstacle, the boys went directly to the obstructed toy, making contact with it three times faster than with the unobstructed toy
In all, the boys in this study demonstrated the classic terrible twos' response to a limitation of their freedom: outright defiance
5 Why should psychological reactance emerge at the age of two? Per haps the answer has to do with a crucial change that most children go through around this time
It is then that they first come to a full recog nition of themselves as individuals
No longer do they view themselves as mere extensions of the social milieu but rather as identifiable, singu lar, and separate
6 This developing concept of autonomy brings naturally with it the concept of freedom
An independent being is one with choices; and a child with the newfound realization that he or she is such a being will want to explore the length and breadth of the options
Perhaps we should be neither surprised nor distressed, then, when our twoyearolds strain incessantly against our will
They have come to a recent and exhilarating perspective on themselves as freestanding hu man entities
Vital questions of volition, entitlements, and control now 186 /   need to be asked and answered within their small minds
The tendency to fight for every liberty and against every restriction might be best understood as a quest for information
By testing severely the limits of their freedoms (and coincidentally, the patience of their parents), the children are discovering where in their worlds they can expect to be controlled and where they can expect to be in control
As we will see later, the wise parent provides highly consistent information
Although the terrible twos may be the most noticeable age of psycho logical reactance, we show the strong tendency to react against restric tions on our freedoms of action throughout our lives
One other age does stand out, however, as a time when this tendency takes an espe cially rebellious form: teenage
Like the twos, this is a period character ized by an emerging sense of individuality
For teenagers, the emergence is from the role of child, with all of its attendant parental control, and toward the role of adult, with all of its attendant rights and duties
Not surprisingly, adolescents tend to focus less on the duties than on the rights they feel they have as young adults
Not surprisingly, again, imposing traditional parental authority at these times is often counter productive; the teenager will sneak, scheme, and fight to resist such attempts at control
Nothing illustrates the boomerang quality of parental pressure on adolescent behavior quite so clearly as a phenomenon known as the "Romeo and Juliet effect." As we know, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet were the illfated Shakespearean characters whose love was doomed by a feud between their families
Defying all parental attempts to keep them apart, the teenagers won a lasting union in their tragic act of twin suicide, an ultimate assertion of free will
The intensity of the couple's feelings and actions has always been a source of wonderment and puzzlement to observers of the play
How could such inordinate devotion develop so quickly in a pair so young? A romantic might suggest rare and perfect love
A social scientist, though, might point to the role of parental interference and the psycho logical reactance it can produce
Perhaps the passion of Romeo and Juliet was not initially so consuming that it transcended the extensive barriers erected by the families
Perhaps, instead, it was fueled to a white heat by the placement of those barriers
Could it be that had the youngsters been left to their own devices, their inflamed devotion would have amounted to no more than a flicker of puppy love? Because the story is fiction, such questions are, of course, hypothetical, and any answers to them are speculative
However, it is possible to ask and answer with more certainty similar questions about modernday Romeos and Juliets
Do couples suffering parental interference react by   187 committing themselves more firmly to the partnership and falling more deeply in love? According to a study done with 140 Colorado couples, that is exactly what they do
In fact, the researchers found that although parental interference was linked to some problems in the relation ship — the partners viewed one another more critically and reported a greater number of negative behaviors in the other — that interference also made the pair feel greater love and desire for marriage
During the course of the study, as parental interference intensified, so did the love experience; and when the interference weakened, romantic feelings actually cooled
7 Although the Romeo and Juliet effect among modern teenagers may seem cute — to outside observers — other manifestations of teenage re actance can prove tragic
For more than a decade, the major message of a massive advertising campaign for Virginia Slims cigarettes has been that today's women "have come a long way" from the old days when they were required by social norms to be subdued, proper, and ladylike
No longer, imply these ads, should a woman have to feel bound by chauvinistic and outmoded constraints on her independence and, pointedly, on her freedom to smoke cigarettes
Has the message been successful in triggering defiance of the old strictures among the target audience? One dismaying statistic suggests a lamentable answer: During the lengthy duration of this campaign, the percentage of cigarette smokers has risen in only one U.S
demographic group — teenage wo men
For twos and teens, then, psychological reactance flows across the broad surface of experience, always turbulent and forceful
For most of the rest of us, the pool of reactant energy lies quiet and covered, erupting geyserlike only on occasion
Still, these eruptions manifest themselves in a variety of fascinating ways that are of interest not only to the student of human behavior but to lawmakers and policymakers as well
For instance, there's the odd case of Kennesaw, Georgia, the town that enacted a law requiring every adult resident to own a gun and ammunition, under penalty of six months in jail and a twohundred dollar fine
All the features of the Kennesaw gun law make it a prime target for psychological reactance: The freedom that the law restricts is an important, longstanding one to which most American citizens feel entitled
Furthermore, the law was passed by the Kennesaw City Council with a minimum of public input
Reactance theory would predict that under these circumstances few of the adults in the town of fiftyfour hundred would obey
Yet newspaper reports testified that three to four weeks after passage of the law, firearms sales in Kennesaw were — no pun intended — booming
188 /   How are we to make sense of this apparent contradiction of the react ance principle? By looking a bit more closely at those who were buying Kennesaw's guns
Interviews with Kennesaw store owners revealed that the gun buyers were not town residents at all, but visitors, many of them lured by publicity to purchase their initial gun in Kennesaw
Donna Green, proprietor of a shop described in one newspaper article as a virtual "grocery store of firearms," summed it up: "Business is great
But they're almost all being bought by people from out of town
We've only had two or three local people buy a gun to comply with the law 
" After passage of the law, then, gun buying had become a frequent activity in Kennesaw, but not among those it was intended to cover; they were massively noncompliant
Only those individuals whose freedom in the matter had not been restricted by the law had the inclin ation to live by it
A similar situation arose a decade earlier and several hundred miles to the south of Kennesaw, when Dade County (containing Miami), Florida, imposed an antiphosphate ordinance prohibiting the use — and possession! — of laundry or cleaning products containing phosphates
A study done to determine the social impact of the law discovered two parallel reactions on the part of Miami residents
First, in what seems a Florida tradition, many Miamians turned to smuggling
Sometimes with neighbors and friends in large "soap caravans," they drove to nearby counties to load up on phosphate detergents
Hoarding quickly developed; and in the rush of obsession that frequently characterizes hoarders, families were reported to boast of twentyyear supplies of phosphate cleaners
The second reaction to the law was more subtle and more general than the deliberate defiance of the smugglers and hoarders
Spurred by the tendency to want what they could no longer have, the majority of Miami consumers came to see phosphate cleaners as better products than before
Compared to Tampa residents, who were not affected by the Dade County ordinance, the citizens of Miami rated phosphate de tergents as gentler, more effective in cold water, better whiteners and fresheners, more powerful on stains
After passage of the law, they had even come to believe that phosphate detergents poured more easily than did the Tampa consumers
This sort of response is typical of individuals who have lost an estab lished freedom and is crucial to an understanding of how psychological reactance and scarcity work on us
When our freedom to have something is limited, the item becomes less available, and we experience an in creased desire for it
However, we rarely recognize that psychological reactance has caused us to want the item more; all we know is that we want it
Still, we need to make sense of our desire for the item, so we   189 begin to assign it positive qualities to justify the desire
After all, it is natural to suppose that if one feels drawn to something, it is because of the merit of the thing
In the case of the Dade County antiphosphate law — and in other instances of newly restricted availability — that is a faulty supposition
Phosphate detergents clean, whiten, and pour no better after they are banned than before
We just assume they do because we find that we desire them more
The tendency to want what has been banned and therefore to presume that it is more worthwhile is not limited to such commodities as laundry soap
In fact, the tendency is not limited to commodities at all but ex tends to restrictions on information
In an age when the ability to ac quire, store, and manage information is becoming increasingly the de terminant of wealth and power, it is important to understand how we typically react to attempts to censor or otherwise constrain our access to information
Although much data exist on our reactions to various kinds of potentially censorable material — media violence, pornography, radical political rhetoric — there is surprisingly little evidence as to our reactions to the act of censoring them
Fortunately, the results of the few studies that have been done on the topic are highly consistent
Al most invariably, our response to the banning of information is a greater desire to receive that information and a more favorable attitude toward it than before the ban
9 The intriguing thing about the effects of censoring information is not that audience members want to have the information more than they did before; that seems natural
Rather, it is that they come to believe in the information more, even though they haven't received it
For example, when University of North Carolina students learned that a speech op posing coed dorms on campus would be banned, they became more opposed to the idea of coed dorms
Thus, without ever hearing the speech, they became more sympathetic to its argument
This raises the worrisome possibility that especially clever individuals holding a weak or unpopular position can get us to agree with that position by arranging to have their message restricted
The irony is that for such people — members of fringe political groups, for example — the most effective strategy may not be to publicize their unpopular views, but to get those views officially censored and then to publicize the censor ship
Perhaps the authors of this country's Constitution were acting as much as sophisticated social psychologists as staunch civil libertarians when they wrote the remarkably permissive freespeech provision of the First Amendment
By refusing to restrain freedom of speech, they may have been attempting to minimize the chance that new political 190 /   notions would win support via the irrational course of psychological reactance
Of course, political ideas are not the only kind that are susceptible to restriction
Access to sexually relevant material is frequently limited
Although not as sensational as the occasional police crackdowns on "adult" bookstores and theaters, regular pressure is applied by parents and by citizens' groups to censor the sexual content of educational material ranging from sex education and hygiene texts to books on the shelves of school libraries
Both sides in the struggle seem to be well intentioned, and the issues are not simple, since they involve such matters as morality, art, parental control over the schools, and First Amendment freedoms
But from a purely psychological point of view, those favoring strict censorship may wish to examine closely the results of a study done on Purdue University undergraduates
10 The students were shown some advertisements for a novel
For half the students, the advertising copy included the statement, "a book for adults only, restric ted to those 21 years and over"; the other half of the students read about no such age restriction on the book
When the researchers later asked the students to indicate their feelings toward the book, they discovered the same pair of reactions we have noted with other bans: Those who learned of the age restriction (1) wanted to read the book more and (2) believed that they would like the book more than did those who thought their access to the book was unlimited
It might be argued that although these results may be true for a small sample of sexually inclined college students, they would not apply to students in junior and senior high schools, where the sex curricula battles are actually being waged
Two factors make me doubt such an argument
First, developmental psychologists report that as a general style, the desire to oppose adult control begins quite soon in adolescence, around the start of the teenage years
Nonscientific observers have also noted the early rise of these strong oppositional tendencies
Shakespeare, scholars tell us, placed Romeo and Juliet at the ages of fifteen and thir teen years, respectively
Second, the pattern of reactions exhibited by the Purdue students is not unique and thus can't be attributed to any great preoccupation with sex that college students may have
The pattern is common to externally imposed restrictions in general
Limiting access to the book had the same effects as did banning phosphate detergent in Florida or censoring a speech in North Carolina: The people involved came to want the restricted item more and, as a result, came to feel more favorable toward it
Those who support the official banning of sexually relevant materials from school curricula have the avowed purpose of reducing the orient ation of the society, especially its youth, toward eroticism
In the light   191 of the Purdue study and in the context of other research on the effects of imposed restraints, one must wonder whether official censorship as a means may not be antithetical to the goal
If we are to believe the im plications of the research, then the censorship is likely to increase the desire of students for sexual material and, consequently, to cause them to view themselves as the kind of individuals who like such material
The term "official censorship" usually makes us think of bans on political or sexual material; yet there is another common sort of official censorship that we don't think of in the same way, probably because it occurs after the fact
Often in a jury trial, a piece of evidence or testimony will be introduced, only to be ruled inadmissible by the presiding judge, who may then admonish the jurors to disregard that evidence
From this perspective, the judge may be viewed as a censor, though the form of censorship is odd
The presentation of the information to the jury is not banned — it's too late for that — it's the jury's use of the information that is banned
How effective are such instructions from a judge? And is it possible that, for jury members who feel it is their right to consider all the available information, declarations of inadmissibility may actually cause psychological reactance, leading the jurors to use the evidence to a greater extent? These were some of the questions asked in a largescale juryresearch project conducted by the University of Chicago Law School
One reason the results of the Chicago jury project are informative is that the parti cipants were individuals who were actually on jury duty at the time and who agreed to be members of "experimental juries" formed by the researchers
These experimental juries then heard tapes of evidence from previous trials and deliberated as if they were deciding the case
In the study most relevant to our interest in official censorship, thirty such juries heard the case of a woman who was injured by a car driven by a careless male defendant
The first finding of the study was no surprise: When the driver said he had liability insurance, the jurors awarded his victim an average of four thousand dollars more than when he said he had no insurance (thirtyseven thousand dollars vs
thirty three thousand dollars)
Thus, as insurance companies have long sus pected, juries make larger awards to victims if an insurance company will have to pay
The second finding of the study is the fascinating one, though
If the driver said he was insured and the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible (directing the jury to disregard it), the instruction to disregard had a boomerang effect, causing an average award of forty six thousand dollars
So when certain juries learned that the driver was insured, they increased the damage payment by four thousand dollars
But when other juries were told officially that they must not use that information, they used it still more, increasing the damage payment by 192 /   thirteen thousand dollars
It appears, then, that even proper, official censorship in a courtroom setting creates problems for the censor
We react to information restriction there, as usual, by valuing the banned information more than ever
1 The realization that we value limited information allows us to apply the scarcity principle to realms beyond material commodities
The principle works for messages, communications, and knowledge, too
Taking this perspective, we can see that information may not have to be censored for us to value it more; it need only be scarce
According to the scarcity principle, then, we will find a piece of information more persuasive if we think we can't get it elsewhere
This idea that exclusive information is more persuasive information is central to the thinking of two psychologists, Timothy Brock and Howard Fromkin, who have developed a "commodity theory" analysis of persuasion
12 The strongest support I know for Brock and Fromkin's theory comes from a small experiment done by a student of mine
At the time, the student was also a successful businessman, the owner of a beefimport ing company, who had returned to school to get advanced training in marketing
After we talked in my office one day about scarcity and ex clusivity of information, he decided to do a study using his sales staff
The company's customers — buyers for supermarkets or other retail food outlets — were phoned as usual by a salesperson and asked for a purchase in one of three ways
One set of customers heard a standard sales presentation before being asked for their orders
Another set of customers heard the standard sales presentation plus information that the supply of imported beef was likely to be scarce in the upcoming months
A third group received the standard sales presentation and the information about a scarce supply of beef, too; however, they also learned that the scarcesupply news was not generally available inform ation — it had come, they were told, from certain exclusive contacts that the company had
Thus the customers who received this last sales presentation learned that not only was the availability of the product limited, so also was the news concerning it — the scarcity double whammy
The results of the experiment quickly become apparent when the company salespeople began to urge the owner to buy more beef because there wasn't enough in the inventory to keep up with all the orders they were receiving
Compared to the customers who got only the standard sales appeal, those who were also told about the future scarcity of beef bought more than twice as much
But the real boost in sales oc curred among the customers who heard of the impending scarcity via "exclusive" information
They purchased six times the amount that the customers who received only the standard sales pitch did
Apparently   193 the fact that the news carrying the scarcity of information was itself scarce made it especially persuasive
13 OPTIMAL CONDITIONS Much like the other effective weapons of  , the scarcity principle is more effective at some times than at other times
An important prac tical problem, then, is to find out when scarcity works best on us
A great deal can be learned in this regard from an experiment devised by social psychologist Stephen Worchel
14 The basic procedure used by Worchel and his research team was simple: Participants in a consumer preference study were given a chocolatechip cookie from a jar and asked to taste and rate its quality
For half of the raters, the jar contained ten cookies; for the other half, it contained just two
As we might expect from the scarcity principle, when the cookie was one of the only two available, it was rated more favorably than when it was one of ten
The cookie in short supply was rated as more desirable to eat in the future, more attractive as a consumer item, and more costly than the identical cookie in abundant supply
Although this pattern of results provides a rather striking validation of the scarcity principle, it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know
Once again, we see that a lessavailable item is more desired and valued
The real worth of the cookie study comes from two additional findings
Let's take them one at a time, as each deserves a thorough consideration
The first of these noteworthy results involved a small variation in the experiment's basic procedure
Rather than rating the cookies under conditions of constant scarcity, some participants were first given a jar of ten cookies that was then replaced by a jar of two cookies
Thus, be fore taking a bite, certain of the participants saw their abundant supply of cookies reduced to a scarce supply
Other participants, however, knew only scarcity of supply from the outset, since the number of cookies in their jars was left at two
With this procedure, the researchers were seeking to answer a question about types of scarcity: Do we value more those things that have recently become less available to us, or those things that have always been scarce? In the cookie experiment, the answer was plain
The drop from abundance to scarcity produced a decidedly more positive reaction to the cookies than did constant scarcity
The idea that newly experienced scarcity is the more powerful kind applies to situations well beyond the bounds of the cookie study
For example, social scientists have determined that such scarcity is a primary 194 /   cause of political turmoil and violence
Perhaps the most prominent proponent of this argument is James C
Davies, who states that we are most likely to find revolutions where a period of improving economic and social conditions is followed by a short, sharp reversal in those conditions
Thus it is not the traditionally most downtrodden people — who have come to see their deprivation as part of the natural order of things — who are especially liable to revolt
Instead, revolution aries are more likely to be those who have been given at least some taste of a better life
When the economic and social improvements they have experienced and come to expect suddenly become less available, they desire them more than ever and often rise up violently to secure them
1 Davies has gathered persuasive evidence for his novel thesis from a range of revolutions, revolts, and internal wars, including the French, Russian, and Egyptian revolutions as well as such domestic uprisings as Dorr's Rebellion in nineteenthcentury Rhode Island, the American Civil War, and the urban black riots of the 1960s
In each case, a time of increasing wellbeing preceded a tight cluster of reversals that burst into violence
The racial conflict in America's cities during the mid1960s repre sents a case in point that many of us can recall
At the time, it was not uncommon to hear the question, "Why now?" It didn't seem to make sense that within their threehundredyear history, most of which had been spent in servitude and much of the rest in privation, American blacks would choose the socially progressive sixties in which to revolt
Indeed, as Davies points out, the two decades after the start of World War II had brought dramatic political and economic gains to the black population
In 1940, blacks faced stringent legal restrictions in such areas as housing, transportation, and education; moreover, even with the same amount of education, the average black family earned only a bit more than half of its counterpart white family
Fifteen years later, much had changed
Federal legislation had struck down as unacceptable formal and informal attempts to segregate blacks in schools, public places, housing, and employment settings
Targe economic advances had been made, too; black family income had risen from 56 percent to 80 percent of that of a comparably educated white family
But then, according to Davies's analysis of social conditions, this rapid progress was stymied by events that soured the heady optimism of previous years
First, political and legal change proved substantially easier to enact than social change
Despite all the progressive legislation of the forties and fifties, blacks perceived that most neighborhoods, jobs, and schools remained segregated
Thus the Washingtonbased victories came to feel like defeats at home
For example, in the four years following the U.S
Supreme Court's 1954 decision to integrate all   195 public schools, blacks were the targets of 530 acts of violence (direct intimidation of black children and parents, bombings, and burnings) designed to prevent school integration
This violence generated the perception of another sort of setback in black progress
For the first time since well before World War II, when lynchings had occurred at an average rate of seventyeight per year, blacks had to be concerned about the basic safety of their families
The new violence was not limited to the education issue, either
Peaceful civilrights demonstrations of the time were frequently confronted by hostile crowds — and police
Still another type of downturn occurred — in pocketbook progress
In 1962, the income of a black family had slid back to 74 percent of that of a similarly educated white family
By Davies's argument, the most illuminating aspect of this 74 percent figure is not that it represented a longterm increase in prosperity from pre1940s levels but that it repres ented a shortterm decline from the flush mid1950s levels
In the next year came the Birmingham riots and, in staccato succession, scores of violent demonstrations, building toward the major upheavals of Watts, Newark, and Detroit
In keeping with a distinct historical pattern of revolution, blacks in the United States were more rebellious when their prolonged progress was curtailed somewhat than they were before it began
This pattern offers a valuable lesson for wouldbe rulers: When it comes to freedoms, it is more dangerous to have given for a while than never to have given at all
The problem for a government that seeks to improve the political and economic status of a traditionally oppressed group is that, in so doing, it establishes freedoms for the group where none existed before
And should these now established freedoms become less available, there will be an especially hot variety of hell to pay
We can look to much more recent events in the former Soviet Union for evidence that this basic rule still holds
After decades of repression, Mikhail Gorbachev began granting the Soviet populace new liberties, privileges, and choices via the twin policies of glasnost and perestroika
Alarmed by the direction their nation was taking, a small group of government, military, and KGB officials staged a coup, placing Gorbachev under house arrest and announcing on August 19, 1991, that they had assumed power and were moving to reinstate the old order
Most of the world imagined that the Soviet people, known for their characteristic acquiescence to subjugation, would passively yield as they had always done
Time magazine editor Lance Morrow described his own reaction similarly: "At first the coup seemed to confirm the norm
The news administered a dark shock, followed immediately by a depressed sense of resignation: of course, of course, the Russians must 196 /   revert to their essential selves, to their own history
Gorbachev and glasnost were an aberration; now we are back to fatal normality." But these were not to be normal times
For one thing, Gorbachev had not governed in the tradition of the czars or Stalin or any of the line of oppressive postwar rulers who had not allowed even a breath of free dom to the masses
He had ceded them certain rights and choices
And when these nowestablished freedoms were threatened, the people lashed out the way a dog would if someone tried taking a fresh bone from its mouth
Within hours of the junta's announcement, thousands were in the streets, erecting barricades, confronting armed troops, sur rounding tanks, and defying curfews
The uprising was so swift, so massive, so unitary in its opposition to any retreat from the gains of glasnost that after only three riotous days, the astonished officials relen ted, surrendering their power and pleading for mercy from President Gorbachev
Had they been students of history — or of psychology — the failed plotters would not have been so surprised by the tidal wave of popular resistance that swallowed their coup
From the vantage point of either discipline, they could have learned an invariant lesson: Freedoms once granted will not be relinquished without a fight
The lesson applies as well to the politics of family as country
The parent who grants privileges or enforces rules erratically invites rebel liousness by unwittingly establishing freedoms for the child
The parent who only sometimes prohibits betweenmeal sweets may create for the child the freedom to have such snacks
At that point, enforcing the rule becomes a much more difficult and explosive matter because the child is no longer merely lacking a neverpossessed right but is losing an es tablished one
As we have seen in the case of political freedoms and (especially pertinent to the present discussion) chocolatechip cookies, people see a thing as more desirable when it has recently become less available than when it has been scarce all along
We should not be sur prised, then, when research shows that parents who enforce discipline inconsistently produce generally rebellious children
16 Let's look back to the cookie study for another insight into the way we react to scarcity
We've already seen from the results of that study that scarce cookies were rated higher than abundant cookies and that newly scarce cookies were rated higher still
Staying with the newly scarce cookies now, there was a certain cookie that was the highest rated of all: those that became less available because of a demand for them
Remember that in the experiment the participants who experienced new scarcity had been given a jar of ten cookies that was then replaced with a jar of only two cookies
Actually, the researchers did this in one of two ways
To certain participants, it was explained that some of their   197 cookies had to be given away to other raters to supply the demand for cookies in the study
To another set of participants, it was explained that their number of cookies had to be reduced because the researcher had simply made a mistake and given them the wrong jar initially
The results showed that those whose cookies became scarce through the process of social demand liked them significantly more than those whose cookies became scarce by mistake
In fact, the cookies made less available through social demand were rated the most desirable of any in the study
This finding highlights the importance of competition in the pursuit of limited resources
Not only do we want the same item more when it is scarce, we want it most when we are in competition for it
Advert isers often try to exploit this tendency in us
In their ads, we learn that "popular demand" for an item is so great that we must "hurry to buy," or we see a crowd pressing against the doors of a store before the start of a sale, or we watch a flock of hands quickly deplete a supermarket shelf of a product
There is more to such images than the idea of ordin ary social proof
The message is not just that the product is good because other people think so, but also that we are in direct competition with those people for it
The feeling of being in competition for scarce resources has powerfully motivating properties
The ardor of an indifferent lover surges with the appearance of a rival
It is often for reasons of strategy, therefore, that romantic partners reveal (or invent) the attentions of a new admirer
Salespeople are taught to play the same game with indecisive customers
For example, a realtor who is trying to sell a house to a "fencesitting" prospect will sometimes call the prospect with news of another potential buyer who has seen the house, liked it, and is scheduled to return the following day to talk about terms
When wholly fabricated, the new bidder is commonly described as an outsider with plenty of money: "an outofstate investor buying for tax purposes" and "a physician and his wife moving into town" are favorites
The tactic, called in some circles "goosing 'em off the fence," can work devastatingly well
The thought of losing out to a rival frequently turns a buyer from hesitant to zealous
There is something almost physical about the desire to have a con tested item
Shoppers at big closeout or bargain sales report being caught up emotionally in the event
Charged by the crush of competitors, they swarm and struggle to claim merchandise they would otherwise disdain
Such behavior brings to mind the "feeding frenzy" of wild, indiscriminate eating among animal groups
Commercial fishermen exploit this phenomenon by throwing a quantity of loose bait to large schools of certain fish
Soon the water is a roiling expanse of thrashing 198 /   fins and snapping mouths competing for the food
At this point, the fishermen save time and money by dropping unbaited lines into the water, since the crazed fish will bite ferociously at anything now, includ ing bare metal hooks
There is a noticeable parallel between the ways that commercial fishermen and department stores generate a competitive fury in those they wish to hook
To attract and arouse the catch, fishermen scatter some loose bait called chum
For similar reasons, department stores holding a bargain sale toss out a few especially good deals on promin ently advertised items called loss leaders
If the bait, of either form, has done its job, a large and eager crowd forms to snap it up
Soon, in the rush to score, the group becomes agitated, nearly blinded, by the ad versarial nature of the situation
Humans and fish alike lose perspective on what they want and begin striking at whatever is being contested
One wonders whether the tuna flapping on a dry deck with only a bare hook in its mouth shares the whathitme bewilderment of the shopper arriving home with only a load of departmentstore bilge
Lest we believe that the competitionforlimitedresourcesfever occurs only in such unsophisticated forms of life as tuna and bargainbasement shoppers, we should examine the story behind a remarkable purchase decision made in 1973 by Barry Diller, who was then vice president for primetime programming at the American Broadcasting Company, but who has since been labeled the "miracle mogul" by Time magazine in reference to his remarkable successes as head of Paramount Pictures and the Fox Television Network
He agreed to pay $3.3 million for a single television showing of the movie The Poseidon Adventure
The figure is noteworthy in that it greatly exceeded the highest price ever previ ously paid for a onetime movie showing: $2 million for Patton
In fact, the payment was so excessive that ABC figured to lose $1 million on the Poseidon showing
As NBC vice president for special programs Bill Storke declared at the time, "There's no way they can get their money back, no way at all." How could an astute and experienced businessman like Diller go for a deal that would produce an expected loss of a million dollars? The answer may lie in a second noteworthy aspect of the sale: It was the first time that a motion picture had been offered to the networks in an openbid auction
Never before had the three major commercial net works been forced to battle for a scarce resource in quite this way
The novel idea of a competitive auction was the brainchild of the movie's flamboyant showmanproducer, Irwin Allen, and a 20th Century Fox vice president, William Self, who must have been ecstatic about the outcome
But how can we be sure that it was the auction format that   199 generated the spectacular sales price rather than the blockbuster quality of the movie itself? Some comments from the auction participants provide impressive evidence
First came a statement from the victor, Barry Diller, intended to set future policy for his network
In language sounding as if it could have escaped only from between clenched teeth, he said, "ABC has decided regarding its policy for the future that it would never again enter into an auction situation." Even more instructive are the remarks of Diller's rival, Robert Wood, then president of CBS Television, who nearly lost his head and outbid his competitors at ABC and NBC: We were very rational at the start
We priced the movie out, in terms of what it could bring in for us, then allowed a certain value on top of that for exploitation
But then the bidding started
ABC opened with two million
I came back with two point four
ABC went to two point eight
And the fever of the thing caught us
Like a guy who had lost his mind, I kept bidding
Finally, I went to three point two; and there came a moment when I said to myself, "Good grief, if I get it, what the heck am I going to do with it?" When ABC finally topped me, my main feeling was relief
It's been very educational
17 According to interviewer Bob MacKenzie, when Wood made his "It's been very educational" statement, he was smiling
We can be sure that when ABC's Diller made his "never again" announcement, he was not
Both men had clearly learned something from the "Great Poseidon Auction." But for one, there had been a $1 million tuition charge
Fortu nately, there is a valuable but drastically less expensive lesson here for us, too
It is instructive to note that the smiling man was the one who had lost the highly soughtafter prize
As a general rule, whenever the dust settles and we find losers looking and speaking like winners (and vice versa), we should be especially wary of the conditions that kicked up the dust — in the present case, open competition for a scarce resource
As the TV executives now know, extreme caution is advised whenever we encounter the devilish construction of scarcity plus rivalry
HOW TO SAY NO It is easy enough to feel properly warned against scarcity pressures; but it is substantially more difficult to act on that warning
Part of the problem is that our typical reaction to scarcity hinders our ability to think
When we watch something we want become less available, a physical agitation sets in
Especially in those cases involving direct 200 /   competition, the blood comes up, the focus narrows, and emotions rise
As this visceral current advances, the cognitive, rational side retreats
In the rush of arousal, it is difficult to be calm and studied in our ap proach
As CBS Television's president, Robert Wood, commented in the wake of his Poseidon adventure, "You get caught up in the mania of the thing, the acceleration of it
Logic goes right out the window." Here's our predicament, then: Knowing the causes and workings of scarcity pressures may not be sufficient to protect us from them because knowing is a cognitive thing, and cognitive processes are suppressed by our emotional reaction to scarcity
In fact, this may be the reason for the great effectiveness of scarcity tactics
When they are employed properly, our first line of defense against foolish behavior — a thoughtful analysis of the situation — becomes less likely
If, because of brainclouding arousal, we can't rely on our knowledge about the scarcity principle to stimulate properly cautious behavior, what can we use? Perhaps, in fine jujitsu style, we can use the arousal itself as our prime cue
In this way we can turn the enemy's strength to our advantage
Rather than relying on a considered, cognitive ana lysis of the entire situation, we might simply tune ourselves to the in ternal, visceral sweep for our warning
By learning to flag the experience of heightening arousal in a compliance situation, we can alert ourselves to the possibility of scarcity tactics there and to the need for caution
But suppose we accomplish this trick of using the rising tide of arousal as a signal to calm ourselves and to proceed with care
What then? Is there any other piece of information we can use to help make a proper decision in the face of scarcity? After all, merely recognizing that we ought to move carefully doesn't tell us the direction in which to move; it only provides the necessary context for a thoughtful decision
Fortunately, there is information available on which we can base thoughtful decisions about scarce items
It comes, once again, from the chocolatechipcookie study, where the researchers uncovered something that seems strange but rings true regarding scarcity: Even though the scarce cookies were rated as significantly more desirable, they were not rated as any bettertasting than the abundant cookies
So despite the increased yearning that scarcity caused (the raters said they wanted to have more of the scarce cookies in the future and would pay a greater price for them), it did not make the cookies taste one whit better
Therein lies an important insight
The joy is not in experiencing a scarce commod ity but in possessing it
It is important that we not confuse the two
Whenever we confront the scarcity pressures surrounding some item, we must also confront the question of what it is we want from the item
If the answer is that we want the thing for the social, economic, or psychological benefits of possessing something rare, then, fine; scarcity   201 pressures will give us a good indication of how much we would want to pay for it — the less available it is, the more valuable to us it will be
But very often we don't want a thing purely for the sake of owning it
We want it, instead, for its utility value; we want to eat it or drink it or touch it or hear it or drive it or otherwise use it
In such cases it is vital to remember that scarce things do not taste or feel or sound or ride or work any better because of their limited availability
Although this is a simple point, it can often escape us when we exper ience the heightened desirability that scarce items naturally possess
I can cite a family example
My brother Richard supported himself through school by employing a compliance trick that cashed in hand somely on the tendency of most people to miss that simple point
In fact, his tactic was so effective that he had to work only a few hours each weekend for his money, leaving the rest of the time free for his studies
Richard sold cars, but not in a showroom nor on a car lot
He would buy a couple of used cars sold privately through the newspaper on one weekend and, adding nothing but soap and water, would sell them at a decided profit through the newspaper on the following weekend
To do this, he had to know three things
First, he had to know enough about cars to buy those that were offered for sale at the bottom of their bluebook price range but could be legitimately resold for a higher price
Second, once he got the car, he had to know how to write a newspaper ad that would stimulate substantial buyer interest
Third, once a buyer arrived, he had to know how to use the scarcity principle to generate more desire for the car than it perhaps deserved
Richard knew how to do all three
For our purposes, though, we need to examine his craft with just the third
For a car he had purchased on the prior weekend, he would place an ad in the Sunday paper
Because he knew how to construct a good ad, he usually received an array of calls from potential buyers on Sunday morning
Each prospect who was interested enough to want to see the car was given an appointment time — the same appointment time
So if six people were scheduled, they were all scheduled for, say, two o'clock that afternoon
This little device of simultaneous scheduling paved the way for later compliance because it created an atmosphere of competi tion for a limited resource
Typically, the first prospect to arrive would begin a studied examin ation of the car and would engage in standard carbuying behavior, such as pointing out any blemishes or deficiencies or asking if the price was negotiable
The psychology of the situation changed radically, however, when the second buyer drove up
The availability of the car to either prospect suddenly became limited by the presence of the other
202 /   Often the earlier arrival, inadvertently stoking the sense of rivalry, would assert his right to primary consideration
"Just a minute, now
I was here first." If he didn't assert that right, Richard would do it for him
Addressing the second buyer, Richard would say, "Excuse me, but this other gentleman was here before you
So can I ask you to wait on the other side of the driveway for a few minutes until he's finished looking at the car? Then, if he decides he doesn't want it or if he can't make up his mind
I'll show it to you." Richard claims it was possible to watch the agitation grow on the first buyer's face
His leisurely assessment of the car's pros and cons had suddenly become a nowornever, limitedtimeonly rush to decision over a contested resource
If he didn't decide for the car — at Richard's asking price — in the next few minutes, he might lose it for good to that..
that..
lurking newcomer over there
For his part, the second buyer would be equally agitated by the combination of rivalry and re stricted availability
He would pace on the periphery, visibly straining to get at this now more desirable hunk of metal
Should twoo'clock appointment number one fail to buy or even fail to decide quickly enough, twoo'clock appointment number two was ready to pounce
If these conditions alone were not enough to secure a favorable pur chase decision immediately, the trap snapped surely shut as soon as the third twoo'clock appointment arrived on the scene
According to Richard, stackedup competition was usually too much for the first prospect to bear
He would end the pressure quickly by either agreeing to Richard's price or by leaving abruptly
In the latter instance, the second arrival would strike at the chance to buy out of a sense of relief coupled with a new feeling of rivalry with that..
that..
lurking new comer over there
All those buyers who contributed to my brother's college education failed to recognize a fundamental fact about their purchases: The in creased desire that spurred them to buy had little to do with the merits of the car
That failure of recognition occurred for two reasons
First, the situation Richard arranged for them produced an emotional reaction that made it difficult for them to think straight
Second, as a con sequence, they never stopped to think that the reason they wanted the car in the first place was to use it, not merely to have it
And the com petitionforascarceresource pressures Richard applied affected only their desire to have the car in the sense of possessing it
Those pressures did not affect the value of the car in terms of the real purpose for which they had wanted it
Should we find ourselves beset by scarcity pressures in a compliance situation, then, our best response would occur in a twostage sequence
  203 As soon as we feel the tide of emotional arousal that flows from scarcity  s, we should use that rise in arousal as a signal to stop short
Panicky, feverish reactions have no place in wise compliance decisions
We need to calm ourselves and regain a rational perspective
Once that is done, we can move to the second stage by asking ourselves why we want the item under consideration
If the answer is that we want it primarily for the purpose of owning it, then we should use its availab ility to help gauge how much we want to spend for it
However, if the answer is that we want it primarily for its function (that is, we want something good to drive, drink, eat, etc.), then we must remember that the item under consideration will function equally well whether scarce or plentiful
Quite simply, we need to recall that the scarce cookies didn't taste any better
READER'S REPORT From a Blacksburg, Virginia, Woman "Last Christmas I met a twentysevenyearold man
I was nineteen
Although he really wasn't my type, I went out with him — probably because it was a status thing to date an older man — but I really didn't become interested in him until my folks expressed their concern about his age
The more they got on my case about it, the more in love I be came
It only lasted five months, but this was about four months longer than it would have lasted if my parents hadn't said anything." Although Romeo and Juliet have long since passed away, it appears that the "Romeo and Juliet effect" is alive and well and making regular appearances in places like Blacksburg, Virginia
Epilogue INSTANT   Primitive Consent for an Automatic Age Every day in every way, I'm getting better
— Emile Coue Every day in every way, I'm getting busier
— Robert Cialdini D ACK IN THE 1960S A MAN NAMED JOE PINE HOSTED A RATHER remark able TV talk show that was syndicated from California
The program was made distinctive by Pine's caustic and confrontational style with his guests — for the most part, a collection of exposurehungry entertain ers, wouldbe celebrities, and representatives of fringe political or social organizations
The host's abrasive approach was designed to provoke his guests into arguments, to fluster them into embarrassing admissions, and generally to make them look foolish
It was not uncommon for Pine to introduce a visitor and launch immediately into an attack on the in dividual's beliefs, talent, or appearance
Some people claimed that Pine's acid personal style was partially caused by a leg amputation that had embittered him to life; others said no, that he was just vituperous by nature
One evening rock musician Frank Zappa was a guest on the show
This was at a time in the sixties when very long hair on men was still 206 /   unusual and controversial
As soon as Zappa had been introduced and seated, the following exchange occurred: PINE: I guess your long hair makes you a girl
ZAPPA: I guess your wooden leg makes you a table
Aside from containing what may be my favorite adlib, the above dialogue illustrates a fundamental theme of this book: Very often in making a decision about someone or something, we don't use all the relevant available information; we use, instead, only a single, highly representative piece of the total
And an isolated piece of information, even though it normally counsels us correctly, can lead us to clearly stupid mistakes — mistakes that, when exploited by clever others, leave us looking silly or worse
At the same time, a complicating companion theme has been present throughout this book: Despite the susceptibility to stupid decisions that accompanies a reliance on a single feature of the available data, the pace of modern life demands that we frequently use this shortcut
Recall that early in Chapter 1, our shortcut approach was likened to the automatic responding of lower animals, whose elaborate behavior patterns could be triggered by the presence of a lone stimulus feature — a "cheepcheep" sound, a shade of red breast feather, or a specific sequence of light flashes
The reason infrahumans must often rely on such solitary stim ulus features is their restricted mental capability
Their small brains cannot begin to register and process all the relevant information in their environments
So these species have evolved special sensitivities to certain aspects of the information
Because those selected aspects of information are normally enough to cue a correct response, the system is usually very efficient: Whenever a female turkey hears "cheepcheep," click, whirr, out rolls the proper maternal behavior in a mechanical fashion that conserves much of her limited brainpower for dealing with the variety of other situations and choices she must face in her day
We, of course, have vastly more effective brain mechanisms than mother turkeys, or any other animal group, for that matter
We are unchallenged in the ability to take into account a multitude of relevant facts and, consequently, to make good decisions
Indeed, it is this in formationprocessing advantage over other species that has helped make us the dominant form of life on the planet
Still, we have our capacity limitations, too; and, for the sake of effi ciency, we must sometimes retreat from the timeconsuming, sophistic ated, fully informed brand of decision making to a more automatic, primitive, singlefeature type of responding
For instance, in deciding   207 whether to say yes or no to a requester, it is clear that we frequently pay attention to but one piece of the relevant information in the situ ation
We have been exploring several of the most popular of the single pieces of information that we use to prompt our compliance decisions
They are the most popular prompts precisely because they are the most reliable ones, those that normally point us toward the correct choice
That is why we employ the factors of reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so automatically in making our compliance decisions
Each, by itself, provides a highly re liable cue as to when we will be better off saying yes than no
We are likely to use these lone cues when we don't have the inclina tion, time, energy, or cognitive resources to undertake a complete ana lysis of the situation
Where we are rushed, stressed, uncertain, indiffer ent, distracted, or fatigued, we tend to focus on less of the information available to us
When making decisions under these circumstances, we often revert to the rather primitive but necessary singlepieceofgood evidence approach
1 All this leads to a jarring insight: With the sophist icated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created an environment so complex, fastpaced, and informationladen that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion of the animals we long ago transcended
John Stuart Mill, the British economist, political thinker, and philo sopher of science, died more than a hundred years ago
The year of his death (1873) is important because he is reputed to have been the last man to know everything there was to know in the world
Today, the notion that one of us could be aware of all known facts is only laughable
After eons of slow accumulation, human knowledge has snowballed into an era of momentumfed, multiplicative, monstrous expansion
We now live in a world where most of the information is less than fifteen years old
In certain fields of science alone (for example, physics), knowledge is said to double every eight years
And the scientific inform ation explosion is not limited to such arcane arenas as molecular chemistry or quantum physics but extends to everyday areas of know ledge where we strive to keep ourselves current — health, child devel opment, nutrition, and the like
What's more, this rapid growth is likely to continue, since 90 percent of all scientists who have ever lived are working today
Apart from the streaking advance of science, things are quickly changing much closer to home
In his book Future Shock, Alvin Toffler provided early documentation of the unprecedented and increasing rapidity of modern daily life: We travel more and faster; we relocate more frequently to new residences, which are built and torn down more 208 /   quickly; we contact more people and have shorter relationships with them; in the supermarket, car showroom, and shopping mall, we are faced with an array of choices among styles and products that were unheard of the previous year and may well be obsolete or forgotten by the next
Novelty, transience, diversity, and acceleration are acknow ledged as prime descriptors of civilized existence
This avalanche of information and choices is made possible by bur geoning technological progress
Leading the way are developments in our ability to collect, store, retrieve, and communicate information
At first, the fruits of such advances were limited to large organiza tions — government agencies or powerful corporations
For example, speaking as chairman of Citicorp, Walter Wriston could say of his company, "We have tied together a data base in the world that is capable of telling almost anyone in the world, almost anything, immediately." 2 But now, with further developments in telecommunication and com puter technology, access to such staggering amounts of information is falling within the reach of individual citizens
Extensive cable and satellite television systems provide one route for that information into the average home
The other major route is the personal computer
In 1972, Norman Macrae, an editor of The Economist, speculated prophetically about a time in the future: The prospect is, after all, that we are going to enter an age when any duffer sitting at a computer terminal in his laboratory or office or public library or home can delve through unimaginable in creased mountains of information in massassembly data banks with mechanical powers of concentration and calculation that will be greater by a factor of tens of thousands than was ever available to the human brain of even an Einstein
One short decade later
Time magazine signaled that Macrae's future age had arrived by naming a machine, the personal computer, as its Man of the Year
Time's editors defended their choice by citing the consumer "stampede" to purchase small computers and by arguing that "America [and], in a larger perspective, the entire world will never be the same." Macrae's vision is now being realized
Millions of ordinary "duffers" are sitting at machines with the potential to present and analyze enough data to bury an Einstein
Because technology can evolve much faster than we can, our natural capacity to process information is likely to be increasingly inadequate to handle the surfeit of change, choice, and challenge that is character istic of modern life
More and more frequently, we will find ourselves   209 in the position of the lower animals — with a mental apparatus that is unequipped to deal thoroughly with the intricacy and richness of the outside environment
Unlike the animals, whose cognitive powers have always been relatively deficient, we have created our own deficiency by constructing a radically more complex world
But the consequence of our new deficiency is the same as that of the animals' longstanding one
When making a decision, we will less frequently enjoy the luxury of a fully considered analysis of the total situation but will revert in creasingly to a focus on a single, usually reliable feature of it
When those single features are truly reliable, there is nothing inher ently wrong with the shortcut approach of narrowed attention and automatic response to a particular piece of information
The problem comes when something causes the normally trustworthy cues to counsel us poorly, to lead us to erroneous actions and wrongheaded decisions
As we have seen, one such cause is the trickery of certain compliance practitioners who seek to profit from the rather mindless and mechan ical nature of shortcut response
If, as seems true, the frequency of shortcut response is increasing with the pace and form of modern life, we can be sure that the frequency of this trickery is destined to increase as well
What can we do about the expected intensified attack on our system of shortcuts? More than evasive action, I would urge forceful counter assault
There is an important qualification, however
Compliance professionals who play fairly by the rules of shortcut response are not to be considered the enemy; on the contrary, they are our allies in an efficient and adaptive process of exchange
The proper targets for counteraggression are only those individuals who falsify, counterfeit, or misrepresent the evidence that naturally cues our shortcut responses
Let's take an illustration from what is perhaps our most frequently used shortcut
According to the principle of social proof, we often decide to do what other people like us are doing
It makes all kinds of sense since, most of the time, an action that is popular in a given situation is also functional and appropriate
Thus, an advertiser who, without using deceptive statistics, provides information that a brand of toothpaste is the largest selling or fastest growing has offered us valuable evidence about the quality of the product and the probability that we will like it
Provided that we are in the market for a tube of good toothpaste, we might want to rely on that single piece of information, popularity, to decide to try it
This strategy will likely steer us right, will unlikely steer us far wrong, and will conserve our cognitive energies for dealing with the rest of our increasingly informationladen, decisionoverloaded environment
The advertiser who allows us to use effectively this effi 210 /   dent strategy is hardly our antagonist but rather must be considered a cooperating partner
The story becomes quite different, however, should a compliance practitioner try to stimulate a shortcut response by giving us a fraudu lent signal for it
The enemy is the advertiser who seeks to create an image of popularity for a brand of toothpaste by, say, constructing a series of staged "unrehearsedinterview" commercials in which an array of actors posing as ordinary citizens praise the product
Here, where the evidence of popularity is counterfeit, we, the principle of social proof, and our shortcut response to it, are all being exploited
In an earlier chapter, I recommended against the purchase of any product featured in a faked "unrehearsedinterview" ad, and I urged that we send the product manufacturers letters detailing the reason and suggest ing that they dismiss their advertising agency
I would recommend extending this aggressive stance to any situation in which a compliance professional abuses the principle of social proof (or any other weapon of  ) in this manner
We should refuse to watch TV programs that use canned laughter
If we see a bartender beginning a shift by salting his tip jar with a bill or two of his own, he should get none from us
If, after waiting in line outside a nightclub, we discover from the amount of available space that the wait was designed to impress pass ersby with false evidence of the club's popularity, we should leave im mediately and announce our reason to those still in line
In short, we should be willing to use boycott, threat, confrontation, censure, tirade, nearly anything, to retaliate
I don't consider myself pugnacious by nature, but I actively advocate such belligerent actions because in a way I am at war with the ex ploiters — we all are
It is important to recognize, however, that their motive for profit is not the cause for hostilities; that motive, after all, is something we each share to an extent
The real treachery, and the thing we cannot tolerate, is any attempt to make their profit in a way that threatens the reliability of our shortcuts
The blitz of modern daily life demands that we have faithful shortcuts, sound rules of thumb to handle it all
These are not luxuries any longer; they are outandout necessities that figure to become increasingly vital as the pulse of daily life quick ens
That is why we should want to retaliate whenever we see someone betraying one of our rules of thumb for profit
We want that rule to be as effective as possible
But to the degree that its fitness for duty is regularly undercut by the tricks of a profiteer, we naturally will use it less and will be less able to cope efficiently with the decisional burdens of our day
We cannot allow that without a fight
The stakes have gotten too high
General introduction Over the last 20 years, the development of new techniques for studying the brain has led to a dramatic breakthrough in our understanding of neurobiological processes
The period 1990 to 2000 was designated 'the decade of the brain', and from this time onwards an increase in funding for neuroscience has been accompanied by growing professional and public interest in this subject
One of the issues identified as potentially fruitful for inquiry is: why, in both animals and man, do some substances result in a compulsion to use, even if they are harmful or result in negative consequences? Historically, the nature of dependence and addiction has been as much an area for philosophical as scientific discourse
Indeed some have, and continue to, argue that the notion itself is a social rather than biological construct
However, this debate has been enriched by our ability to understand better the mechanism of the brain and neuroscience is now providing us with a growing understanding of the neurobiological basis for addiction
This understanding is important as it is likely to have implications for both how we understand, and respond to, the drug problems that modern societies face
There is now increasing evidence that many addictive phenomena have a genetic and neurobiological basis
Research in this area offers the promise of identifying the neural correlates of compulsive behaviour in addiction which could lead to more effective treatments for addiction and as a consequence increased investment in addiction treatment and further research (McLellan et al., 2000; Dackis and O'Brien, 2005; Volkow and Li, 2005)
It can also be argued that an increased understanding of the neurobiological basis of addiction or drug dependence f) will lend support for more humane social policies that recognise addiction as a neuropsychiatric condition that should be treated therapeutically (Dackis and O'Brien, 2005; Volkow and Li, 2005)
This can be contrasted to the historically more punitive approach to addiction where it is viewed largely as a moral failing best dealt with by the criminal justice system
Optimism about the benefit that a better understanding of the biological basis for addiction may bring needs to be tempered by more critical considerations, as overly simplistic or reductionistic interpretations of what this kind of approach reveals about addiction could result in less welcome consequences, especially if inappropriate use is made of some of the novel approaches emerging in this field
Indeed, some of the earlier pronouncements made about the implications of the decade of the brain for addiction treatment now appear overly optimistic
Even today, some proponents in this area appear to let their enthusiasm for promoting potentially useful new approaches run ahead of the emerging science and the need for appropriate testing and clinical scrutiny
This report attempts to tread a middle line, alerting the reader to the potential benefits emerging from this exciting area of new research but also arming them with an f) The terms addiction and drug dependence are used interchangeably in this report
17 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications understanding of the issues involved, the uncertainties that still exist, and the potential pitfalls that could result from the inappropriate use of some of the approaches that this research may soon make possible
To achieve this aim, this report provides the latest understanding of attempts to get to grips with the brain changes that accompany illicit drug use, most notably in those that become addicted
We have tried to make the science understandable to a general audience although by necessity some of the concepts addressed are complex ones
The report investigates here both the possible welcome and unwelcome uses of neurobiological research with the aims of highlighting ways that will maximise the benefits that may arise, while minimising any unanticipated harms
The focus is on illicit drugs, rather than licit psychoactive substances, as this is the remit for the work of the EMCDDA
This distinction, from a neurobiological perspective, is to a large part arbitrary and much of the general argument applies equally to all substances with a potential to cause dependence
However, this approach is not without value as other reports have focused on the implications of neurobiological research on alcohol (Midanik, 2006) and tobacco (Hall, 2007), and the illicit nature of the drugs covered here has important implications for some of the ethical concerns explored
This report falls naturally into two parts
First, a concise and accessible summary of the key findings of recent research on the genetics and neuroscience of addiction to illicit drugs is provided
Central to this is the delineation of the structures that make up the circuits within the brain that give rise to a system that is fundamental for our survival, reward processing
A number of key chemical neurotransmitters are pivotal in enabling this system to operate with dopamine playing a central role
The understanding that neuroscience provides of the importance of the reward system in addictive behaviour now means it may be possible to develop novel pharmacological treatments that could impact not only on the reward system per se but also on those systems that subserve cognitive functions such as learning and memory
The second part of this report explores some of the key social and ethical issues raised by neurobiological research (a term used as shorthand here to cover both genetic and neuroscience research)
This includes a discussion of how this research may influence the way that modern societies think about drug use and addiction and deal with the ethical issues raised by technological applications of this knowledge
The report also considers the more speculative possibility that addiction neurobiology may improve our ability to prevent the development of addiction (e.g
by using genetic screening to identify individuals at high risk of addiction and 'drug vaccines' to prevent these individuals from using drugs)
The analysis is limited to the use of medical (e.g
neurological, immunological, and pharmacological) treatments of addiction
However, an important caveat is that psychosocial therapies, although not addressed in detail in this report, play an important part in the treatment of addiction, and are a critical adjunct to the effectiveness of existing medical treatments
This should not be taken as an indication 18 General introduction that psychosocial treatments will not continue to play a significant role in the future of addiction treatment, rather that the major ethical issues raised by developments in the neuroscience of addiction involve the application of medical technologies
Any report on this topic risks becoming quickly outdated as new scientific findings emerge
Some of the approaches described here have already advanced to the stage of clinical trials and may make an important contribution to the future treatment of addicted individuals
Other approaches may fall by the wayside as further investigation reveal them to have limited potential or practical application
For this reason it is not the aim of this report to make any definitive conclusion on the issues raised
Rather by highlighting recent advances in neurobiology of addiction, and the ethical issues that arise from such knowledge, the aim is to encourage a more informed discourse on the implications of neurobiological research on addiction within the European Union
To this end, the report concludes with some general suggestions about the directions in which this debate is likely to develop and those areas that will clearly require further consideration and investigation
Some observations are also elaborated, within a general context of human rights and good clinical practice that are relevant to any future policy consideration of how new approaches might be applied
Genetic predisposition and the information from genetic treatment, the use of drug vaccines and coercive treatment are just a sample of the issues that both the public and politicians alike will have to contend with in the coming years as our understanding of the neuroscience and genetics advances
It has been an amazing achievement to begin to unravel the complexities of the brain and understand the insights that this knowledge provides for our understanding of drug dependence
But the complex issues in this area are not all biological ones, perhaps an equal challenge will be ensure these findings are applied in ways that maximises benefits and avoids unintended or unwelcome consequences
Richard Muscat, Adrian Carter, Paul Griffiths, Dominique Lopez and Wayne Hall 19 Chapter 1 What is addiction? Adrian Carter, Wayne Hall and Benjamin Capps Introduction Addiction and drug abuse exact an enormous toll upon European society, largely as a result of premature death, physical harm and increased health care costs, violence and crime
A significant proportion of the European population will become addicted to licit or illicit drugs during their lifetime
Given the health and social burden of addiction, there is strong public interest in preventing addiction and improving the chances that addicts will stop using drugs
The policies that are often used to pursue these goals depend critically on how drug use and addiction are understood
Drug addiction is a pattern of behaviour in which an individual uses a drug despite the harm that its use causes, and despite often wanting to stop
Many addicts report they find it difficult to stop using drugs and they are likely to relapse to drug use if they succeed in stopping
There has been significant controversy about the nature of addiction between supporters of two dominant models
Medical models hold that addiction is a psychiatric disorder that requires treatment
In contrast, moral models are sceptical about the existence of an addictive disorder and see drug use as a choice that individuals make and for which they should be punished if the drug use is illegal or if they engage in criminal behaviour to fund their drug use
Neuroscience research promises to clarify our understanding of drug use and addiction by showing how drugs affect brain function and how chronic drug use changes the brain in ways that make it more difficult for addicts to stop using drugs
The chronic use of addictive drugs produces enduring changes in the motivation, learning and decision making centres of the brain that focus attention on drug use and impair the ability to choose not to use drugs (see Chapter 2)
This research has led to the 'chronic and relapsing brain disease' model of addiction
This research has the potential to significantly impact upon the way in which we treat addiction
Scientific knowledge about the neurochemical changes underpinning addiction promises to improve our ability to treat, and possibly, prevent addiction
Neuroscience research may also change the way in which society thinks about addiction and the legal and social policies that are appropriate to deal with it
If addiction is a brain disease that impairs behaviour, it may lead to more humane treatment of those with an addiction
Conversely, it may also be used to increase support for more coercive use of medical technology to treat or more controversially 'cure' addiction
21 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications This section outlines the social and economic burden of drug use and addiction in Europe
It also outlines the very different ways in which drug use and addiction have been understood and discusses how this understanding has changed in response to addiction neuroscience research
The sections that follow will explore the impact of neuroscience on addiction in greater detail, and analyse the ethical and social implications of this research for European policy
The cosf of addiction Addiction, or drug dependence, is a chronic condition which has an enormous adverse impact on society
In most western countries, such as the United Kingdom (UK), United States (US) and Australia, a significant proportion of the population will develop an addiction to illicit drugs during their lifetime (lifetime prevalence range 46 %) or alcohol (815 %) or both (AIHW, 1999; Kessler et al., 2005; SAMSHA, 2006; McKeganey et al., 2007) (')
A wider range of prevalence estimates have been reported in European countries, with point prevalences for illicit drug dependence ranging from 0.12 %, and 0.17 % for alcohol (AndlinSobocki and Rehm, 2005) ( 2 )
By definition, addiction is the habitual use of a substance (or engaging in an activity such as compulsive gambling) despite the harms caused and impaired control over use, as indicated by failed attempts to stop
Addiction is commonly understood as a disorder ( 3 ) in which an individual's control over their drug use is impaired
People with an addiction continue to use drugs in the face of enormous negative consequences, and despite often expressing a wish that they could stop
This definition is codified in the DSMIVTR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illness, 4th edition Text Revised) and ICD10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition) diagnostic criteria for substance dependence or addiction, which describe it as a 'loss of control' over drug use, where drug taking becomes 'compulsive' and consumes a great deal of an individual's time and resources, to the detriment of other important social roles, such as working or caring for children (World Health Organization, 1993b; American Psychiatric Association, 2000)
Drug abuse and addiction lead to increased deaths from suicide, overdose and drugimpaired driving
There are also increased health costs from the toxic and psychopathological effects of chronic drug use (e.g
liver cirrhosis from alcohol abuse, druginduced psychoses, cognitive impairments and drugrelated injuries), C) These statistics do not include addiction to substances such as nicotine and caffeine
( 2 ) Prevalence data varies considerably, and is plagued with methodological inconsistencies
Levels of dependence and substance abuse can differ significantly between countries, and the types of drugs abused may vary across Europe
The EMCDDA website provides more detailed data on drug use prevalence in all EU Member States: http://www.emcdda
europa.eu/ ( 3 ) The term 'disorder' may be seen as implying a disease model of addiction, but in this instance the term is being used in its weakest sense to describe patterns of behaviour that commonly cooccur, are statistically uncommon and are associated with social and personal impairment
22 Chapter 1: What is addiction? and the complications of injecting drug use that include thromboses, septicaemia and the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood borne diseases
It is estimated that there are between 6 500 and 8 500 acute drugrelated deaths (e.g
overdoses) in Europe every year (approximately 3.5 % of all deaths in European adults aged 1539 years in 200506) adding up to about 130 000 deaths since 19902005 (EMCDDA, 2008)
These figures do not include deaths attributed to drugrelated accidents, violence, suicides or chronic illnesses
Within some European cities, approximately 1023 % of the overall mortality among young adults (1549 years old) can be attributed either directly or indirectly to opioid use (EMCDDA, 2008)
Addicted illicit drug users also often engage in crime and violence to finance their drug use
This leads to substantial judicial and prison costs
Illicit drug abuse is associated with increased criminality, with 6580 % of arrestees in the UK having used illicit drugs in the 12 months prior to being arrested (McKeganey et al., 2007)
Chronic use of some substances (e.g
cocaine and methamphetamine) can also produce neuropsychological changes associated with impulsive violence
Drug abuse leads to lost employment and increased social welfare, and broader adverse impacts on families and relationships (EMCDDA, 2006; Hall et al., 2006)
The social and economic costs of drug abuse and addiction in European nations are substantial (EMCDDA, 2008)
There is limited consistent data on the cost of drug abuse in Europe, as Member States differ significantly in what they report as a drugrelated cost (EMCDDA, 2008)
While the economic burden of drug abuse and addiction can be difficult to quantify, ( 4 ) it has been estimated that 10 % of the overall burden of disease in Europe is attributable to substance use disorders and addiction (Rehm et al., 2005)
In the UK, where reporting includes a broad range of druguse associated costs, the estimated current economic burden of illicit drug use is GBP 13 billion/year, largely due to costs associated with crime
Alcohol contributes a further GBP 20 billion/year (Nutt et al., 2007a)
Studies suggest that the burden of drug use is rising because of increases in the number of people abusing drugs and in the quantity of drugs that they use (EMCDDA, 2007a; McKeganey et al., 2007)
Despite the enormous costs of addiction and drug use, a minority of those with addiction receive treatment, and often this treatment is only modestly effective (McKeganey et al., 2007)
Of those that did receive treatment in 2006, half were treated primarily for opioid use (principally heroin), and increasingly given access to effective treatments, such as methadone and buprenorphine maintenance (EMCDDA, 2008)
However, the majority of individuals with a drug addiction do not receive treatment for their condition in the US (Demyttenaere et al., 2004), or the UK (McKeganey et al., 2007)
( 4 ) Not only do countries differ in what they report as a burden on drug use or addiction, but it can be difficult to distinguish between what is a burden of a substance use disorder, and what is a consequence of nonaddicted drug use (AndlinSobocki and Rehm, 2005)
23 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications The nontherapeutic use of opiates (e.g
heroin or morphine) and psychostimulants (e.g
cocaine or methamphetamine) is prohibited in all European countries
Cannabis is illegal in most European countries although laws on possession and use are often not rigorously enforced
The distribution of these drugs is illegal and many individuals may be charged with an offence, and possibly imprisoned as a result of criminal activities (such as drug selling or property crime) that are engaged in to fund the use of an expensive illegal substance
Understanding addiction The way in which society has traditionally understood addiction, and thought of those who are addicted, has changed over many decades (White, 1998)
Addiction is a complex behavioural disorder that is influenced by biological, psychological and sociological factors
It is the prototypical biopsychosocial disorder
As our understanding of how each of these elements impacts on addiction changes, so do our social policies to deal with it, as well as the treatments that are used to reduce or prevent it
This section describes two competing models of addiction — the medical and moral, or sceptical models of addiction
These two models represent the extremes of perceptions of addiction and provide a useful construct with which to think about governing views of Figure 1: Governing ideas about drug use This is a schematic diagram depicting the development of dominant attitudes towards drug use during the twentieth century
The trajectory of the line was determined from an expert committee's judgements about the 'ideological "centre of gravity'" in the US, based on canonical historic texts (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990)
Arguably, since this study was conducted, there has been a considerable shift back towards the medical model of addiction, largely due to advances in the neuroscience research of addiction

This section analyses the ability of each model to explain the phenomenology of addiction and highlights some of the potential consequences of each approach for social policies and treatment outcomes
Sceptical versus medical models of addiction The dominant 'moral' or 'sceptical' view of addiction holds that 'addicts' are simply drug users who knowingly and willingly choose to use drugs without regard for the adverse consequences that their actions bring upon themselves and others
In this sceptical view, 'addiction' is an 'excuse' for continuing to use drugs while 'avoiding responsibility' for the consequences of doing so (Szasz, 1975; Davies, 1997)
Sceptical views make sense of one of the key features of 'addictive behaviour': drug use is initially a voluntary choice that develops into an addictive pattern in a minority of those who use most drugs, including the most addictive illicit drugs such as heroin, and cocaine (Anthony et al., 1994)
Proponents of this view argue that even among the significant minority of drug users who do become addicted, most succeed in stopping their use by themselves (Peele, 2004)
Sceptical views of addiction, however, are inconsistent with a number of reliable empirical observations about drug use and addictive behaviour
First, a significant minority of people who use drugs become addicted and the size of that minority depends on the way that the drug is consumed and its pharmacological actions, e.g
its rapidity of onset and duration of effect (Anthony and Helzer, 1991)
Hence, short acting opioids like heroin that are injected are more likely to result in addiction than drugs like alcohol that people drink
Second, there is also an identifiable subset of individuals who are more likely to develop an addiction
This includes people who have more contact with drugs or peers who use drugs, who use drugs at an earlier age, who are from socially disadvantaged backgrounds or perform poorly in school, who have a family history of addictive behaviour, or suffer from a mental disorder (Hawkins et al., 1992)
Third, the use of drugs in the face of often serious negative health and social consequences and in the absence of any pleasure derived from their use, suggests that addiction is more than mere wilful bad behaviour
These observations have led to a 'medical centred' model of addiction, according to which heavy drug use over long periods of time produces physiological and psychological changes in the individual that progressively override the degree of 'choice' they are able to exercise in using the drug
The worldwide prevalence of sceptical views of addiction, and the significant personal and social harm that drug abuse causes, have led to punitive laws to discourage drug use, and a comparative lack of investment in medical research into addiction or the development of interventions to treat it
Despite the broad acceptance of these policies, ( 5 ) It is important to note they these two models are generally only theoretical constructs for understanding addiction
Most realworld views on addiction lie somewhere along a continuum between these two views
25 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications efforts have largely proven ineffective in reducing drug use and addiction, and have often contributed to the social cost of addiction by leading to the imprisonment of many drug users who typically return to drug use and reoffend upon release (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990; National Research Council, 2001)
These policies have also led to discrimination and inappropriate restriction or derogation of the rights of those who are addicted
The fact that these policies have been largely unsuccessful in reducing drug use or addiction indicates that alternative explanations are required that consider the effect that repeated drug use has on an individual's ability to choose whether or not to take that drug
Such explanations increasingly appeal to neurobiological theories of addiction, which lend support more readily to 'medical centred' policies
Although such policies still advocate predominately punitive measures, medical treatment and social support and action are also encouraged to deal with addicts and problem drug users
The 'Chronic and Relapsing Brain Disease' model of addiction Neuroscience research of addiction is challenging traditional notions of addiction as a purely voluntary choice
Studies are beginning to show that chronic drug use can produce longlasting changes in brain function that make drug use a central preoccupation and undermine the capacity of individuals to refrain from using drugs
A theory that is gaining widespread attention, particularly in the US, is the 'chronic, relapsing brain disease' model first described by the former Director of the National Institute on Drug Addiction (NIDA), Dr
Alan Leshner (1997)
According to NIDA, addiction is caused by chronic selfadministration of drugs that produce enduring changes in brain neurotransmitter systems, leaving addicts vulnerable to relapse after abstinence has been achieved (Leshner, 1997; Volkow and Li, 2005)
In the same way that cardiovascular disease is a result of abnormal heart tissue, the chronic disease model of addiction holds that addiction is the result of abnormal neural tissue (Volkow and Li, 2004)
26 Chapter 2 The neurobiology of addiction Adrian Carter, Wayne Hall and David Nutt Introduction Neuroscience is beginning to uncover the neurochemical changes that occur within particular functional regions of the brain that are responsible for the behaviour in addiction
In doing so, neuroscience research is beginning to help us see that those who are addicted to drugs suffer from neurocognitive and motivational impairments that require treatment
Our cognitive abilities enable us to quickly discern which activities are worth pursuing in our environment
We engage in activities that are 'rewarding' and serve survival values such as obtaining food, shelter, or sex
These rewards are generally experienced as pleasurable and motivate behaviour
We quickly learn which activities are rewarding and what environmental cues are associated with receiving these rewards
These cues acquire an incentive or motivating quality that ensures that we pursue the goals that they signal in the future
Highly motivating goals or events become deeply engrained in our thinking, allowing us to respond to these rewards quickly and effortlessly, habitually and without conscious thought
This learning increases the efficiency and power of thought by focussing our attention and energy on what is relevant in the environment, making it more likely that we will achieve our goals with a minimum of effort
Not all forms of learned and rewarding activities are desirable
In addiction, drug use becomes overlearned because repeated drug use overactivates the central reward systems in the brain, enabling drug use to take precedence over all other goaldirected activities that are essential to survival
This ability for addictive drugs to strongly activate the reward pathway is commonly referred to as their reinforcing effect
Chronic use of addictive drugs can also dampen the central reward pathway's responsiveness to everyday rewarding activities that motivate us and give life meaning, such as relationships, work and education
These changes are also believed to explain why the pursuit of drugs can come to dominate the lives of many addicts, at the expense of most other interests
29 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Addiction also impairs a number of other cognitive processes that perpetuate drug use
Many of these are included in the diagnostic criteria for drug dependence or addiction (World Health Organization, 1993b; American Psychiatric Association, 2000)
They include: • a feeling of compulsion to use drugs; • an impaired ability to avoid using drugs when opportunities arise; • an impaired understanding of the consequences of continued drug taking; and • the ability for cues associated with drug use (e.g
location, time of day, or activities) and stress to produce a relapse to drug use in an abstinent individual, even months or years after stopping
Addiction neurobiology is beginning to uncover how chronic use of addictive drugs can also disrupt other important neural pathways in the brain that lead to these cognitive deficits
Chronic drug use can produce neurochemical changes in the higher cortical regions of the front of the brain (the frontal cortex), that make drug use so appealing, and can impair the ability to override impulses not to use drugs
This has the effect of focussing the attention of the addicted individual on drug use, and can make decisions not to use drugs more difficult
These changes are also believed to explain the emergence of intense cravings for the drug of addiction, and continued drug use despite enormous negative consequences for the addict
Neuroadaptations within other parts of the frontal cortex are also understood to be involved in the impaired ability to appreciate the consequences of continued drug use
The discovery of persistent changes within the regions of the brain responsible for learning and memory also helps to explain why relapse to drug use is so common, even despite months and sometimes years of abstinence
Neuroadaptations at the synapses within these regions give memories of drug use a heightened salience
Consequently, events or cues that recall these memories (e.g
an image of injecting equipment or the drug itself; revisiting places where the drug was consumed), have the ability to trigger intense cravings for the drug of addiction, which often results in a relapse to drug use
These neuroadaptations have been seen in addicted individuals who have been abstinent for months (Volkow and Fowler, 2000)
Stress is a potent trigger of relapse, and neuroscience is also beginning to explain how chronic drug use can leave addicted individuals vulnerable to relapse when under stress
Research has also identified neuropsychological and genetic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addiction if they use drugs
By providing a better understanding of how addiction develops, this research highlights the potential for new psychological and pharmacological treatments to treat and, more speculatively, prevent addiction (see Chapter 3)
30 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction Neuroscience suggests that addiction is a pathological behaviour in which addictive drugs coopt normal learning and motivating pathways in the brain so that drug taking comes to dominate all other goaldirected activities
Such a view has the potential to not only unlock a wide array of new and powerful treatments of addiction that target or ameliorate these changes, but also has the potential to change how we think about and treat those with an addiction (see Chapter 1 and this chapter)
Given the central importance of the brain and the strong moral attitudes that many people feel towards those who abuse or are addicted to drugs, the nature and impact of these changes needs to be considered
Such an analysis will need to critically examine the emerging neuroscience research on addiction
This research also has implications for the types of social policies we use to reduce addiction and harmful drug use
The social and ethical implications of this research are explored in Chapter 5
This section will review current neuroscience research of addiction, and will explain how the chronic abuse of addictive drugs can alter the neurochemical structure and function of the brain in ways that lead to the psychology of addiction
The neuroanatomy of addiction Addiction is a quintessentially complex behavioural disorder that operates at the biological, psychological and social levels
This complexity is reflected in the number of neurocognitive systems that are affected by drug addiction
These systems have often been studied in isolation, leading to the development of competing partial models that purport to explain all of addiction
A more complete picture of the neuroanatomy of addiction is beginning to emerge from the convergence of these different approaches
Neuroimaging, using technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has provided critical insights into the way in which druginduced changes in the brain can produce the type of cognitive deficits seen in drugaddicted people
The ability to directly visualise the brain of addicted individuals has identified changes in multiple brain systems that may explain loss of control and compulsive drug taking
These changes may also explain why abstinence is difficult to achieve and why relapse so often occurs after long periods of abstinence
The neurocognitive systems that are affected by addictive drugs include: • reward and reinforcement — in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) • compulsion, craving and inhibitory control — in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus (aCG) • executive control and cognitive impairment — in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) • memory, learning and habits — in the amygdala, hippocampus and striatum • representation of bodily urges — in the insula cortex • stress — in the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis
31 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Figure 2: Projections from midbrain and NAcc to forebrain Dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, project to the central reward area, the nucleus accumbens and to the cortical areas primarily responsible for making decisions, such as whether to use drugs (e.g
the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus)
Projections from the midbrain also make connections with the striatum (e.g
caudate and putamen)

Changes to the dopaminergic reward pathway, with its dense connections to the forebrain and the higher cognitive centres of the frontal cortex, are central to the development of addictive behaviours (see Figure 2)
However, this is not the complete picture
This research is still only in its infancy and there is still considerable uncertainty about the degree to which these neural regions are involved in addiction
It is also unclear how the activities in these various brain regions differ between individuals
In particular, there is debate within the field as to whether addiction results from (1) abnormally strong urges, drives or motivation that overcome our normal ability to inhibit behaviour or exercise executive control, or (2) cognitive impairment that reduces the ability to inhibit everyday impulses, or (3) some combination of the two
This section briefly reviews neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes that underpin these cognitive behaviours and how they develop and maintain the cycle of addiction
It concludes with a brief review of individual differences in genetic and neuropsychological makeup that can leave some vulnerable to drug use, or developing an addiction if they use drugs
The impact that social events can have on how these vulnerabilities are expressed is also briefly discussed
Reward and reinforcement: the 'Dopamine Hypothesis' In 2007, neuroscientists celebrated the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the key neurotransmitter, dopamine, by Arvid Carlsson who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2000 (Bjorklund and Dunnett, 2007)
It is probably the most widely studied neurochemical, and it has had a greater impact on biological psychiatry and psychopharmacology than any 32 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction other neurotransmitter (Iversen and Iversen, 2007)
Dopamine is a central neurotransmitter that serves a variety of functions
These include: the finetuning of motor control and cognitive function; modulating the salience of events and attention, learning and memory; bonding and attachment in relationships; and the planning and motivation of behaviour
Many of the most widely used medications in psychiatry act on the dopaminergic system
It is now widely accepted that dopamine also plays an important role in addiction to most drugs of abuse (Volkow and Li, 2004), although the nature of this role remains a subject for debate and further study
Research is beginning to show that addiction also involves changes within a number of neurochemicals and neurotransmitter systems such as the endogenous opioids, glutamate and gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) (Goodman, 2008), some of which are discussed below
While changes in these systems are indeed important in a variety of addictions, they nearly all appear to exert their influence through the dopaminergic reward system (Goodman, 2008)
A complete discussion of all the neurochemicals involved in addiction is beyond the scope of this report
Those interested in the neurochemical activity of other molecules in addiction, in particular the important roles of norepinephrine and serotonin should refer to the comprehensive review by Goodman (2008) (')
Amphetamines, cocaine, alcohol, nicotine and cannabis, directly or indirectly, act on a forebrain structure known as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) producing large and rapid releases of dopamine (Robbins et al., 2007)
This increase in dopamine is central to the development of addiction
The signal produced by these drugs originates in the neurons of the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), which release dopamine into synapses in the NAcc (Wise and Bozarth, 1987; Koob and Bloom, 1988; Di Chiara, 1998), as shown in Figure 2
Cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy directly increase the amount of dopamine available for postsynaptic signalling either by increasing dopamine release or by reducing dopamine reuptake from the synapse (Hutcheson et al., 2001) ( 2 )
(See Figure 3)
Alcohol, cannabis and nicotine ( 3 ) increase dopamine activity indirectly, by stimulating neurons that influence dopaminergic neurons (Koob and Le Moal, 1997; Nisell et al., 1994)
For example, as shown in Figure 4, alcohol binds to GABA receptors that reduce the inhibitory influence of GABAergic neurons on dopaminefiring cells
(') Since 2005, pharmacological and genetic studies have highlighted an important role for norepinephrine and serotonin in the development and maintenance of addictive behaviours (Salomon et al., 2006)
It has even been suggested that these changes could occur independently of dopamine (Lanteri et ah, 2007)
Such research appears to contradict studies that block dopamine during the selfadministration of addictive drugs in animals (Koob and Le Moal, 2006)
There is considerable debate in this area and more research is required
Interested readers are directed to a recent article in Biochemical Pharmacology (Tassin, 2008)
( 2 ) Dopamine reuptake is reduced by blocking the dopamine agonist transporter (DAT), which increases the amount of dopamine in the synapse, and therefore dopamine signalling
( 3 ) It must be noted that nicotine appears to be an atypical addictive drug as the increases in dopamine as a result of nicotine ingestion are not as high as those seen with other addictive substances (e.g
psychostimulants and opiates)
There is some evidence to suggest that the addictive capacity of nicotine may depend in part on other chemicals contained in tobacco, such as the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (see Villegier, 2006)
33 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Figure 3: Psychostimulant increase of dopamine activity at the accumbens Cocaine inhibits monoamine reuptake b Amphetamines cause monoamine release Stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine increase synaptic dopamine at the nucleus accumbens by: (a) blocking the dopamine agonist transporter (DAT) (i.e
cocaine) which reuptakes dopamine from the synapse, thus increasing the amount of dopamine active in the synapse thereby increasing dopamine signalling; or (b) entering the dopamine neurons via the DAT (i.e
amphetamine) and causing an increase in dopamine released by the neuron (Hyman et al., 2006)

Figure 4: Actions of a variety of drugs on accumbal dopamine activity Nearly all drugs of addiction act by increasing the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (here indicated as NAc; bottom right)
This increase may be direct, such as the case with stimulants, which increases the release of dopamine by neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA; bottom left)
Other drugs of addiction (e.g
alcohol, cannabis and nicotine) increase dopamine activity indirectly, by influencing neurons which then change the amount of dopamine released into the NAcc
This may be the result of an inhibition of a disinhibiting response, such as occurs with opiates, as well as an excitatory response (e.g
nicotine)
Note: V refers to an excitatory response, denotes inhi bition (Hyman et al., 2006)

34 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction Dopamine, reward and learning The NAcc is a critical part of the neural system that is involved in learning, reward and motivation
Everyday rewarding activities, or natural reinforcers, such as food, relationships and sex, produce much smaller increases in dopamine in the NAcc than drugs of addiction (Kelley and Berridge, 2002)
Some addictive drugs produce over 10 times more dopamine in the NAcc than natural reinforcers, and the increased dopamine response to drugs lasts much longer
It is this excess release of dopamine by addictive drugs that is thought to make drug use so much more appealing than everyday rewarding activities (Hyman, 2005) (see Figure 5)
Figure 5: Rewarding activities increase dopamine signalling Drugs of addiction act on the brain's reward pathway to cause enormous increases in dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens
Everyday activities also increase dopamine activity in this reward pathway, but to a much smaller extent
The exaggerated release of dopamine due to drugs such as cocaine produces changes in other parts of the nervous system that focuses attention on drug use
Redrawn from NIDA 'Drugs, brains and behavior: The science of addiction', Washington DC, 2007
The increase in dopamine signalling in the NAcc was believed to give drugs their rewarding or euphoric affects
Imaging of brain function during intoxication shows that increases in accumbal dopamine are correlated with subjective reports of euphoria (Volkow et al., 2004a)
This is clearest for stimulant drugs where the greater the dopamine release in the NAcc, the greater the euphoria that is reported (Laruelle et al., 1995; Drevets et al., 2001)
This is not always the case, however
There are many studies which show a poor correlation between subjective states of pleasure and drugtaking (Robinson and Berridge, 2000)
As addiction progresses, the consumption of larger amounts of drugs does not increase the pleasure experienced; in fact in most cases, rewarding or euphoric experiences decrease with increasing use
Moreover, nicotine is a highly addictive drug that increases dopamine release in the NAcc in the absence of 35 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications any significant euphoric effects (Nisell et al., 1994; Balfour, 2004; Koob and Le Moal, 2006)
Recent research has suggested that dopaminergic release within the NAcc may in fact reflect the salience, or significance, of stimuli, irrespective of their rewarding or euphoriainducing capacity ( 4 )
Chronic drug use produces changes in the motivation or reward pathway that sensitise the reward system to addictive drugs and drugstimuli
These systems do not mediate the pleasurable or euphoric aspect of drugtaking so much as a 'subcomponent of reward' that is called salience (Robinson and Berridge, 2000, p
s94)
By associating large increases in dopamine with drug taking and drug stimuli learning drives the motivation to take drugs, independently of any pleasure that their use may bring
Thus, events may be perceived as salient not just because of their rewarding effects, but because they are novel or grab attention
This property may explain why aversive or unpleasant stimuli are also able to motivate behaviour (Robinson and Berridge, 2000), why drug use persists long after its immediate effects cease to be rewarding, and why nicotine increases dopamine release without producing euphoric effects (Robbins et al., 2007)
This research suggests that dopamine functions as a signal for learning about experiences
It is released when a rewarding experience is new, better than expected, or unanticipated (Schultz et al., 1997; Schultz, 2006)
It is important in identifying and remembering which activities or experiences are worth pursuing and repeating
Dopamine signalling motivates the repetition of behaviour that increases its release (Berridge and Robinson, 1998)
Hence, when the dopamine system becomes over aroused by drug use, pursuit of the repetition of these effects can dominate other important goaldirected activities
Drugs of addiction exploit this natural reward pathway to motivate repeated use of a drug
The ability for the consumption of an addictive drug to reinforce or motivate repeated drug use by increasing dopamine activity, is the result of acute rewarding events that occur against a background of a normal functioning dopaminergic reward system
While drug use initially increases dopamine release, chronic drug use dramatically decreases dopamine release
The repetitive increase in dopamine release and signalling in the reward pathway leads to a downregulation of dopamine signalling, and a dampening of activity in the reward pathway
The neurochemistry of the reward pathway appears to adapt to the repeated abnormal elevations in dopamine release by compensatory downregulation
This is largely the result of a decrease in the number of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in regions such as the striatum (Volkow and Li, 2004) (see Figure 6)
( 4 ) There is some controversy about the specific role that dopamine plays in these processes of addiction (e.g
reward, incentive salience or motivation, or learning)
Nonetheless, it is likely that changes in dopamine activity as a result of drug use are central to the development of addictive behaviours
This review will not attempt to resolve these debates, but will rather focus on areas where there is consensus
For a thorough discussion, see the 2007 review and commentary in Psychopharmacology (Berridge, 2007; Robbins and Everitt, 2007), or (Kelley and Berridge, 2002)
36 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction These effects significantly reduce activity in the dopaminergic reward system
In these ways, the repeated use of drugs appears to reset the threshold for activating the reward system so that the NAcc becomes less sensitive to the rewarding effects of everyday activities in chronic drug users
However, increased doses of addictive drugs can still produce large dopamine increases that are able to activate the reward centres
As repeated drug use gains enhanced salience over normal or everyday reinforcing activities, the conditioned learning of the association between the drug's effects and associated external cues is strengthened
This reduced activity in the dopamine reward circuit can persist for months after abstinence, and may be one reason why abstinent addicts can relapse months or even years after becoming abstinent (Volkow and Fowler, 2000; Volkow et al., 2004a)
The dampening of the dopamine activity within the reward pathway is also understood to lead to the onset of withdrawal symptoms (see below)
Figure 6: Decreased dopamine receptors due to drug abuse $ V V I 1 Healthy Control Drug Abuse While initial drug use produces large increases in dopamine activity, chronic drug use eventually leads to a significant reduction in dopamine activity
Abuse of the stimulant methamphetamine produces significant decreases in the density of dopamine receptors in the striatum
Such persistent changes in dopamine signalling are thought to explain why individuals with an addiction become so motivated to consume drugs
Reprinted with permission from the American Journal of Psychiatry (© 2001), American Psychiatric Association
Dopamine and withdrawal The changes in the dopaminergic reward system produced by chronic drug use may also explain the process of drug withdrawal (Hyman, 2005; Hyman et al., 2006)
Abrupt cessation of chronic drug use leads to a decrease in dopamine release and elevated thresholds of reward that may lead to drug seeking to relieve the aversive state of withdrawal
In this way, relief of withdrawal symptoms can become a motivational state like thirst or hunger (Hutcheson et al., 2001) that motivates drug seeking (Koob and Le Moal, 1997)
37 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications The dopamine theory of addiction is often referred to as an hedonic model of addiction
That is, it assumes that individuals use addictive drugs in order to experience pleasure and avoid withdrawal symptoms
While withdrawal partially explains the desire of addicts to take drugs, it does not explain the compulsion or loss of control over use in addiction (Tiffany, 1990; O'Brien et al., 1998)
Nor does it explain why addictive drugs like cocaine and amphetamines that do not produce intense withdrawal symptoms, are nonetheless highly addictive
In seeking to explain these phenomena, recent neurobiological research has focused on the effects that chronic drug use has on the functioning of parts of the brain involved in behavioural control, memory, cognition and decisionmaking
The endogenous opioid system The brain's endogenous opioid system is another system that also plays a role in addiction
This is a peptide neurotransmitter system that comprises a number of different peptides (the endorphins, enkephalins and dynorphin) that interact with one of the three opioid receptors — mu, delta and kappa
Mu receptors mediate the pleasurable effects of both opiate drugs, such as heroin and morphine ( 5 ) as well as endogenous opioids, such as the endorphins
The identification of the mu receptor as the site of action for heroin and other opioids led to the use of antagonists (drugs like naloxone and naltrexone that prevent the rewarding effects of heroin by binding to the same receptors) to treat opiate addiction (see p
60)
These antagonists are also clinically useful in alcohol addiction, probably because alcohol also releases endorphins in the brain
Changes in brain opioid receptors may also play a part in addiction to other drugs ( 6 ), which may explain why opioid antagonists, such as naltrexone, appear to be effective in the treatment of other addictions (see p
61)
Research has shown that changes in dopamine and opioids in response to drug use appear to be necessary for developing addiction ( 7 )
But large increases in dopamine activity in the limbic regions are not sufficient for the development of addiction because they can occur in both addicted and nonaddicted individuals
Dopamine release explains why drugs of addiction are rewarding or reinforcing, but it does not explain why some users stop while others continue to use these drugs after their rewarding effects have ceased and in the face of negative social and physical consequences of use
Addiction is due to a number of plastic changes or neuroadaptations throughout the brain that are responsible for the cognitive behaviours necessary for maintaining the cycle of addiction
The neurobiological changes that underpin these cognitive deficits is the next topic of this section
( 5 ) Mice that do not possess mu receptors do not selfadminister opioids (Becker et al., 2000)
( 6 ) PET studies have shown that opioid receptors are increased in people withdrawing from cocaine (Zubieta et al., 1996), opioids (Williams et al., 2007) and alcohol (Heinz et al., 2005)
( 7 ) Dopamine antagonists which block the release of dopamine prevent the reinforcing effects of drug use in animals
While rats treated with dopamine antagonists fail to associate the effects of drug use with the context in which the drugs were given (Hyman, 2005)
38 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction Molecular and cellular changes in addiction There is increasing evidence that chronic drug use, and the changes in dopamine signalling outlined above, produce neuroadaptations in the molecular and cellular neurocircuitry that maintain addiction, especially in the mesolimbic dopamine system
Chronic drug use leads to plastic changes at the synapses in key neural circuits that are believed to be responsible for characteristic addictive behaviours discussed below
There has been significant research since the early 1970s to identify the molecular and cellular processes that can strengthen or weaken the connectivity between neurons; a process first hypothesised to exist as early as 1894 by the pioneering neuroscientist, Ramon y Cajal (Kauer and Malenka, 2007)
This process is now referred to as synaptic plasticity
This refers to the molecular and cellular process by which information, experience or learned responses are stored in the brain
The molecular machinery for synaptic plasticity was first observed in the excitatory glutamate synapses of the hippocampus (Bliss and Lomo, 1973)
This molecular process is referred to as longterm potentiation (LTP) and describes how observed behaviours or learning can be encoded through molecular and cellular changes in neural connectivity
Synaptic plasticity is an activitydependent process that allows synapses to be strengthened (LTP), or weakened (longterm depression or LTD)
LTP is the signalling process which allows the synaptic connection between two neurons to be strengthened
The most widely studied and best understood form of LTP or synaptic plasticity is NmethylDasparate receptor (NMDAR)dependenf LTP
( 8 ) The cooccurrence of NMDAR activation due to presynaptic glutamate release while the postsynaptic membrane is significantly depolarised sets off a signalling cascade that strengthens the synaptic connection
The activation of the NMDAR allows calcium to enter the postsynaptic neuron, triggers the intracellular signalling cascade which results in an increase in the number of aamino3hydroxy5methyl4isoxazole propinonic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the postsynaptic membrane
This signalling cascade also produces morphological changes of the neuron that appear to be essential for the LTP of the synapse
This change in the synapse allows a form of information, whether it be an experience of an event or a learned response, to be encoded in the brain
The process of LTP is best captured in the phrase: 'neurons that fire together, wire together'
The molecular mechanisms that underpin NMDARdependent synaptic plasticity are depicted in Figure 7
These synaptic ( 8 ) The signalling processes involved in synaptic plasticity are extremely complex and can vary somewhat in different regions
This research is also in its infancy so there is significant uncertainty about the specific details
Much more research is required
Consequently, only a brief overview of this area of research is provided, with a focus on areas where there is consensus
The NMDARdependent LTP is discussed to give readers a greater appreciation of the kinds of molecular and cellular changes that are involved in synaptic plasticity
This section is only intended to give the reader an understanding of how chronic use of addictive drugs interferes with molecular and cellular processes in order to produce the psychological behaviours characteristic of addiction
For a more detailed discussion of synaptic plasticity in addiction, see (Kauer and Malenka, 2007)
39 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications changes also involve a number of fundamental cellular processes, such as intracellular signalling, gene regulation and expression, protein synthesis and trafficking, membrane organisation and excitability, and neuronal morphology
The association between synaptic changes and learning and memory was first described in hippocampal neurons, a region important in remembering the details or facts of events (declarative memory)
It has been argued that addiction is a form of pathological learning and memory (Kelley, 2004; Hyman, 2005; Hyman et al., 2006)
However, it is becoming apparent that the plasticity of LTP, and the complementary LTD that involves a weakening of synaptic connectivity, are basic molecular processes that occur at most synapses throughout the brain, including the mesolimbic reward pathway, and cortical regions
They are involved in strengthening or weakening synapses that are associated with a wide variety of cognitive functions
Figure 7: NMDARdependent longterm potentiation Highly simplified schematic diagram of the process of synaptic plasticity observed in the brain's gluta matergic neurons
Nmethyldaspartate receptor (NMDAR)dependent longterm potentiation (LTP) has been observed in many different brain regions
It is dependent upon the cooccurrence of postsy naptic NMDAR activation during significant mem brane depolarization, which then initiates internal signalling molecules, such as calcium/calmodulin dependent proteinkinase II (CaMKII)
These signal ling molecules result in the insertion of a aamino 3hydroxy5methyl4isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) into the postsynaptic membrane — a major mechanism underlying LTP expression
There are several other types of synaptic plasticity that have been observed
We will not discuss them here, but they all involve a network of complex molecular and synaptic changes, similar to those depicted in the Figure (see Kauer and Malenka, 2007 for a more complete discussion)

Postsynaptic dendrite Expression: postsynaptic insertion of AMPARs There is now increasing evidence that the processes involved in synaptic plasticity are involved in the development and maintenance of addiction, and provide the molecular mechanisms for the neuroanatomical changes that underpin the psychological behaviours characteristic of addiction, such as craving, impaired impulse inhibition and relapse (Kauer and Malenka, 2007)
Many of the molecules implicated in LTP and LTD have been shown to be involved in the synaptic plasticity due to drug abuse (Kelley, 2004)
Blocking NMDARs has been shown to prevent the formation of addictive behaviours, and synaptic changes in animal models (Kauer and Malenka, 2007)
40 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction Drugs of abuse can coopt synaptic plasticity mechanisms in the neural circuits involved in reward and reinforcement (Kauer, 2007) in regions of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward pathway, including the VTA and the NAcc
Other limbic regions, including the prefrontal cortex, also undergo neuroadaptations that result in addiction
Synaptic plasticity within the VTA is responsible for the initial acute responses to drugs of abuse, as well as longterm adaptations in regions innervated by the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA (Kauer, 2007; Volkow et al., 2000)
The development of more deeply ingrained addictive behaviours in response to chronic drug use over longer periods of time are the result of plastic changes in the downstream regions, such as the NAcc and other limbic regions
Synaptic plasticity within these regions result in the formation of strong, longlasting associations between the reinforcing aspects of drug use and the various cues, both external and internal, connected with drug use (Calabresi et al., 2007)
It is these longlasting changes that appear to underpin the experience of drug craving, the motivation to use drugs, and relapse on reexposure to experiences associated with drug use or under stress
The study of the synaptic plasticity of addiction is a relatively new endeavour
By identifying the molecular and cellular changes that maintain addiction, it is hoped that it will be possible to develop novel pharmacological drugs by reversing or reducing some of these changes
This will increase our ability to treat and prevent addiction (Calabresi et al., 2007)
The psychological characteristics of addiction, and the neuroanatomical changes that underpin it will be discussed below
Compulsion, craving and inhibitory control In recent years, neuroimaging research has studied changes in regions of the frontal cortex of addicted individuals
Of particular interest has been the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (aCG), which it is hypothesised are involved in craving and compulsive drug taking, and loss of control over drug use, respectively (Volkow and Fowler, 2000; Volkow et al., 2003)
These behaviours are often thought to define addiction
The OFC provides internal representations of the saliency of events and assigns values to them
This allows an individual to compare the likely consequences of pursuing different goals (Schoenbaum et al., 2006)
The aCG is involved in the inhibition of impulses to act (Volkow et al., 2004b; Yucel and Lubman, 2007)
Imaging studies have shown that reduced dopamine activity in the NAcc is correlated with changes in activity in the OFC and the aCG (Goldstein and Volkow, 2002; Volkow et al., 2000; Volkow and Li, 2004)
Exposure to drugs and drugrelated cues dramatically increases dopamine activity in the OFC and aCG of addicted individuals (see Figure 8)
The increased metabolic activity in the OFC and aCG of active drug users in response to increased dopamine activity is thought to partly explain craving
Addicts show increased activation in the OFC when presented with drug cues, memories of past drug experiences or their drug of addiction
The degree of activity in the OFC and aCG 41 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications is correlated with the subjectively reported drug craving (Volkow and Fowler, 2000; Volkow et al., 2004b; Risinger et al., 2005)
Changes in dopamine activity in the OFC also accompany the process of withdrawal (Volkow et al., 1991)
As an addicted drug user undergoes detoxification, metabolic activity within the OFC changes from being extremely high to extremely low
Exposing addicts during withdrawal to either their drug of choice or drugrelated cues produces hyperactivity within the OFC that is correlated with selfreported drug craving
OFC induced craving appears to be responsible for the compulsion to take drugs
These changes within the OFC can persist into abstinence explaining why many abstinent drug users report continued urges to use drugs and relapse in response to drugrelated cues
Figure 8: Plastic changes in the neuroanatomy of addiction This is a schematic diagram of the neuroanatomy of addiction, which depicts the plastic changes that result from chronic drug abuse and produce addiction, (a) The sagittal view of a brain depicting four circuits that are postulated to have key roles in addiction: (1) the prediction of reward and pleasure (red) involve the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and ventral pallidum (VP); (2) memory and learning (purple), occur in the amygdala (Amyg) and hippocampus (HIP); (3) motivation, drive and salience evaluation (green) occur in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); and (4) cognitive control (blue), in charge of restraining cravings, located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus (aCG)
(b) A hypothetical model of addiction
Chronic drug use increases the salience value of a drug (red) and its associated cues (purple) in addiction (right) when compared to the nonaddicted brain (left), whereas the strength of inhibitory control is weakened (blue), setting up the stage for an unrestrained motivation (green)
This results in the repeated use of drugs despite the consequences it causes, and attempts to stop

Executive control and cognitive impairment To the lay person, addicts' continued use of drugs despite adverse consequences seems selfevidently to reflect impaired 'executive control', that is, an impaired ability to reason and rationalise decisions and actions
It is only recently, however, that the neural centres of executive control and cognitive decisionmaking have been implicated in addiction 42 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction (Goldstein and Volkow, 2002; Bechara, 2005; Goldstein et al., 2007)
The decision to continue to use drugs involves the selection of goals from a range of choices
The ability to represent goals, value and select different sequences of actions is thought to depend on the maintenance of goal representations within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Roesch and Olson, 2004; Rolls, 2004)
Hyman (2005, 2006) has suggested that the ability to update information within the PFC, select new goals and avoid the compulsive repetition of a particular behaviour or thought is controlled by dopamine release
It is hypothesised that changes in dopamine signalling can affect our ability to make new goals or choose different behaviours
This appears to be confirmed by computational studies of a type of dopamine firing (called phasic) (Schultz et al., 1997; Schultz, 2006)
This suggests that addictive drugs provide a potent signal that disrupts normal dopaminerelated learning in the PFC
Natural rewards, with relatively low dopamine signalling, may fail to open the PFC gate, powerfully biasing the behaviour of addicts towards drug use and away from normal everyday activities
This hypothesis is supported by neuroimaging studies
Cues that predict drug availability take on an exaggerated incentive salience because of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex
As a result, drugseeking behaviour is strengthened by dopamine effects in the prefrontal cortex (Robbins and Everitt, 1999; Berke and Hyman, 2000; Berke, 2003)
In addition to increased motivation to use drugs, addicted individuals have cognitive impairments that prevent them from recognising the consequences of their drug use and inhibiting impulses to use drugs
Recent imaging research has highlighted changes in the PFC
In particular, changes in the dorsolateral PFC, and the aCG, seem to prevent addicted individuals from considering options other than drug use or for inhibiting drug use (see pp
4042), thereby prolonging use and delaying cessation
The results of neuroimaging studies are supported by neurocognitive tests that have found impaired attention and reduced executive control in addicted individuals (Bechara et al., 2001; Goldstein and Volkow, 2002; Fillmore, 2003; Hester and Garavan, 2004; Bechara, 2005; Goldstein et al., 2007; Yucel and Lubman, 2007)
Several commentators have argued that in addition to the more rational cognitive processes of analysing and balancing different action options, decisionmaking also includes affective and visceral processes (Paulus, 2007)
There is an increasing emphasis of the role that introception — the awareness or sensation of the body — plays in driving us towards choosing certain actions (Damasio et al., 2000; Craig, 2002)
The insular cortex appears to be central in bodily perceptions or feelings, and in the case of addiction, how it plays a key role in explaining why cravings have the ability to capture or steer our thinking and acting
See 'Representing bodily urges', (p
44) for further discussion of introception of drug craving in the insular cortex
In October of 2007, the journal Science ran a special section on the neurobiology of decisionmaking (Koechlin and Hyafil, 2007; Kording, 2007; Paulus, 2007; Sanfey, 43 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications 2007; Stern, 2007), that explained how actions that individuals select are the result of interactions between a number of complex and highly integrated hierarchical neural processes that are distributed throughout the brain (from the 'primitive' parts of the midbrain to the more recently evolved cortical regions) (Paulus, 2007)
This includes a number of neurocognitive processes which are discussed throughout Chapter 2 of this report: (1) assessment and planning; (2) motivation and personal preference; and (3) internal bodily state and the response to an event (Paulus, 2007)
Chronic abuse of addictive drugs appears to have an impact on many, if not all, of these functions
Memory, learning and habifs Key areas of the brain involved in learning have also been implicated in addiction (Everitt and Robbins, 2005)
Addiction involves learning new habits so it is not surprising that changes in the neural pathways that underpin the learning and memory of habitual behaviours (or conditioned responses) are involved in the development of addiction
The neural system involved in the formation of habits is the mesolimbic pathway, a region of the brain that includes the NAcc, amygdala, hippocampus, and the striatum (caudate and putamen)
These memory systems are implicated in: conditioned incentive learning (NAcc and amygdala); habit learning (the caudate and putamen); and declarative memory (the hippocampus)
As noted above, drugrelated cues can elicit craving in abstinent drug users and trigger relapse (O'Brien et al., 1998)
Animal studies of Pavlovian conditioning consistently show that a single exposure to a conditioned stimulus is enough to reinstate addictive behaviours in animals that have been abstinent for long periods of time (Gold and Koob, 1989)
In particular, areas of the limbic system, primarily the hippocampus and the amygdala, have been shown to be critical in the acquisition, consolidation and expression of drugstimulus learning that drives relapse to drugseeking behaviours (Weiss et al., 2000; See, 2005)
This research suggests that changes in brain functioning can lead to the formation of habits, and give special salience to cues and contexts in which drugs are used
These learned drug associations can then cue internal states of craving that perpetuate addiction and lead to relapse ( 9 )
Representing bodily urges The ability to represent the internal state of the body, or introception, is important for an organism to maintain homeostasis — the process which keeps the body functioning in a stable, generally productive condition (Damasio, 1999)
Introception is also critical in shaping or influencing the choices we make (Damasio et al., 2000; Craig, 2002)
It is important in helping to decide what an individual requires in a given situation to suit ( 9 ) More details of the different processes operating in each of these neural regions can be found in White, 1996; Wise, 2004; Robbins, 2002; Everitt and Robbins, 2005
44 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction the body's needs (Paulus, 2007)
These states are often referred to as 'affective states', because we are affected by them, and are also considered to be emotional states
The insula — a region of cortex that lies at the intersection of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes — has been implicated in this process
The insula receives inputs from the cortex and the thalamus that convey information about the emotional and homeostatic state of the body
The insula also has projections to several cortical regions, including the sensory and association cortices, importantly the OFC and aCG, and the brainstem and limbic system, including the amygdala, hypothalamus, NAcc and striatum
These dense connections enable the insula to link information from the body, emotional centres and conscious feelings from cortical regions
The insula is involved in the conscious perception of the physiological state of the body
It sends this information to prefrontal cortical regions to influence decisions on what to do (Everitt and Robbins, 2005) and it also plays a role in emotions and autonomic responses
Given the role that these functions play in addiction, it is not surprising that the insula itself also appears to play such a critical role in addiction (Contreras et al., 2007)
Animal studies suggest that the insula may represent internal body states, such as craving, withdrawal, or the desire to take drugs, that are triggered by drugassociated cues (Kilts et al., 2001; Bonson et al., 2002)
The role of the insular cortex in the experience of drug craving is seen in neuroimaging studies which show that the insula is active during cueinduced craving in addicts and that its activation is correlated with subjective reports of drug craving (Contreras et al., 2007)
The awareness or conscious experience of the body's response to drugs is critical in the maintenance of addictive behaviours
The experience of cravings for drugs is a potent motivator for addicts to use drugs
Inactivation of the insula prevents drug seeking in rats (Contreras et al., 2007)
A recent study also showed that individuals who had lesions in the insula cortex were able to quit smoking easily and did not relapse (Naqvi et al., 2007)
Damage to the insula did not increase the likelihood of quitting but it increased the success of those who tried and reduced their desire to smoke
The role that introception plays in the choices we make, and the role that the insula plays in this process, particularly in addiction, is receiving increasing attention in addiction neuroscience
Targeting these regions may lead to new medical treatments and may help clinicians to develop psychotherapies that attempt to overcome these changes in cognition
Stress and drug use Observational studies of human addicts show that stress is a particularly potent trigger for relapse to drug use (Koob, 1999)
Stressful events, particularly when they occur repeatedly, increase negative affect and thereby make an abstinent drug addict more likely to relapse
Chronic drug use also produces neuroadaptive changes in an 'antireward' pathway that includes the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis 45 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications and the neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) (Koob and Le Moal, 2005)
Individuals in acute drug withdrawal show increased activity of CRF in the HPA and regions of the limbic system, and increased release of noradrenaline and dynorphin, all of which are associated with relapse to drug use
CRF receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce excessive drug taking (Koob and Le Moal, 2005)
Stress and stress hormones can directly affect the natural reward pathways making individuals more vulnerable to developing drug addiction
While both acute and chronic stress affect the dopaminergic reward pathway, the effect they have over time, and their impact on drug use are quite distinct
Acute stress triggers the release of dopamine in the neural reward pathway (Marinelli and Piazza, 2002)
The rapid increase of dopamine in the mesolimbic reward pathway can motivate drug seeking in dependent individuals in the short term, which may lead to relapse (Marinelli and Piazza, 2002)
While chronic stress releases hormones that trigger the release of dopamine into the NAcc (Stamford et al., 1991), the repeated increases in stress hormones, and consequently dopamine, sensitises the reward system over a long period of time (Marinelli and Piazza, 2002)
Chronic stress results in neuroadaptations within the reward pathway that dampen dopaminergic activity and reduce sensitivity to normal rewards
The neuroadaptations to chronic stress are thought to be due to a reduction in the number of dopamine receptors
These neuroadaptations also lead to the development of anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure ( 10 )
This sensitisation of the reward system makes former addicts who experience stress more responsive to drugs of abuse, and therefore, more vulnerable to the development of addiction if they use drugs (Marinelli and Piazza, 2002)
The sensitisation can also persist well after the stress has abated
Genetically based heightened sensitivity to stress or anxiety can make individuals more sensitive to the effects of stress and hence more vulnerable to developing addiction
This is discussed in greater detail below
Vulnerability to addiction: genetic and neuropsychological factors This section briefly summarises research on two related topics: studies of twins and genetic association studies which indicate that genetic factors (such as individual differences in drug metabolism and neurotransmitter responses to drug effects) contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to addiction; and neuropsychological and neuroimaging research which suggests that genetic differences in addiction vulnerability may also underlie individual differences in cognitive performance that influence vulnerability to addiction
( I0 ) This sensitisation of the reward system due to chronic stress, the downregulation of the dopamine receptors and the development of anhedonia is thought to be involved in some cases of depression and suggests why dopamine agonists that aim to ameliorate this effect are effective in the treatment of depression
This discussion is beyond the scope of this report
For further information, see Willner, 1997; Willner, 2005
46 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction Genetic susceptibility to addiction Familial studies have consistently shown that addiction 'runs in families' (Merikangas et al., 1998), suggesting that there is a substantial genetic contribution to addiction vulnerability (Ball and Collier, 2002; Ball et al., 2007)
Addiction is among the most heritable of the complex psychiatric disorders (Goldman et al., 2005), despite the facts that an individual must engage in drug use for the genetic predisposition to be expressed, and that the decision to use a drug can be influenced by personal choices and social policies
Evidence from twin and adoption studies suggest that 4060 % of the risk of developing substance abuse disorders is due to genetic factors, with the percentage depending on the substance (Nestler, 2000; Uhl et al., 2004)
Some studies suggest that the genetic contribution to addiction to some substances, such as cocaine, may be over 70 % (Goldman et al., 2005)
An individual's inherited genetic makeup can influence addiction risk in a number of ways
Genes may affect: the way in which individuals respond to particular substances (e.g
drug metabolism, absorption and excretion and activity or sensitivity to drugs); behavioural traits that influence an individual's willingness to try drugs (e.g
risktaking behaviour, impulsivity, novelty seeking); or the likelihood of developing problem use or dependence if they use drugs (e.g
how rewarding they find the effects of drugs) (Rhee et al., 2003)
This suggests two broad types of genetic predispositions to addiction: (1) genetic profiles that make some individuals more likely to find the acute effects of drugs rewarding and (2) genetic profiles that make individuals more or less susceptible to developing addiction if they use drugs
Significant environmental events, such as adolescent physical or sexual abuse, can interact with genetic susceptibility to increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders (Nestler et al., 1996; Nestler, 2000; Caspi et al., 2005; Goldman et al., 2005; Ball et al., 2007)
These studies provide convincing evidence that both genes and environment play a significant role in the development of addiction (Ball et al., 2007)
Despite the strong evidence of genetic contributions to addiction vulnerability, attempts to reliably identify specific addiction susceptibility genes have been disappointing to date
Largescale linkage and association studies have identified numerous promising candidate genes that confer vulnerability to addiction (Ball and Collier, 2002; Tyndale, 2003) but few of these alleles have been consistently replicated and many of the associations are modest (Tyndale, 2003)
Most of the candidate genes identified so far are associated with the activity of dopamine and the dopaminergic system, dopamine receptors and transporters, (") or proteins which influence the pharmacological activity or metabolism of addictive drugs
(") For example the catecholOmethyl transferase (COMT) and dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2)
47 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Genetically inherited resilience to alcohol addiction The strongest evidence for vulnerability or resilience to addiction concerns a gene, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which encodes a variant of the enzyme involved in the metabolism of ethanol (Thomasson et al., 1991; Chen et al., 1999)
The ALDH2 gene encodes for a less active variant of the metabolic enzyme
Individuals who are homozygous for the ALDH2 allele (i.e
have two copies) are more likely to experience facial flushing, nausea and headaches if they drink alcohol
A high prevalence of these alleles is thought to explain the lower incidence of alcoholism in some East Asian populations (Nestler, 2000)
Addiction is a complex disorder so there are likely to be many genes associated with addiction risk, most of which make a small individual contribution to risk (Khoury et al., 2003; Tyndale, 2003; Hall et al., 2004a; Khoury et al., 2004; Ballet al., 2007)
The most plausible hypothesis is that there are a substantial number of genes that are involved in the initiation, adoption, persistence and cessation of drug abuse, each of which carry a small relative risk (Lerman and Berrettini, 2003)
The effects of these types of genetic profiles will depend on environmental cues and triggers, such as stress, opportunity to use different drugs, peer and parental drug use and so on
Improved understandings of genetic contributions to the development of addictive disorders raise the possibility that we can prevent the onset of drug use and addiction in high risk individuals
By identifying those who are genetically vulnerable to addiction, it may be possible to prevent addiction by vaccinating individuals against the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse
Psychopharmacotherapies could also be tailored to an individual's genomic vulnerabilities (pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics) to allow more effective and efficient addiction treatments
By identifying genes and genetic products involved in the development of addiction, such as initiation, problem drug use, tolerance, withdrawal, dependence, craving and relapse, it may also be possible to develop treatments aimed at an individual's genetic and neuropsychological vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities to addiction: a confluence of the genetic and the social In addition to the genetic susceptibilities, there are social factors that make some individuals more likely to develop an addiction than others
These include socio economic background, exposure to parental drug use, peer drug use and early exposure to drugs, physical or sexual abuse, poor performance at school, and mental disorders such as conduct disorder and anxiety and depressive disorders that develop during adolescence (Hawkins et al., 1992)
48 Chapter 2: The neurobiology of addiction Both genetic and environmental susceptibilities to developing addiction are mediated by neuropsychological changes in the brains of drug users
Genes implicated in addiction are thought to produce changes in the structure or function of specific neural circuits during development that affect an individual's responsiveness to the effects of drug use
The fact that the addiction liability of different drugs (i.e
their neuropharmacological properties) correlates with the genetic risk of addiction suggests that genetic vulnerabilities to addiction are mediated by neurobiology (Goldstein and Kalant, 1990; Goldman et al., 2005)
Environmental stressors and early exposure to drug use, particularly during adolescence and early development, can also have significant neuropsychological effects that leave individuals vulnerable to substance abuse or addiction (Volkow and Li, 2005)
Brain imaging studies suggest that vulnerability may be due to: a decreased sensitivity to natural reinforcers; disrupted activity in control circuits; sensitivity to conditioned drug stimuli; responses of motivation/drive circuits to drugs; and neurobiological factors involved in the modulation of these circuits (Volkow and Li, 2004)
These changes are thought to be mediated by changes in dopaminergic signalling
As already discussed, differences in dopamine circuits are thought to underlie individual differences in responsiveness to drug effects that, in turn, influence vulnerability and resilience (see pp
3237)
This variation in responsiveness to drugs is largely due to genetic makeup
Dopamine activity is also affected by environmental events since stress can increase dopamine release in the NAcc (Koob, 1999) and levels of the dopamine receptors (Papp et al., 1994)
Studies in primates show that dopamine activity is also affected by position in the social hierarchy (Morgan et al., 2002)
Dopamine function also influences predispositions to selfadministration of drugs in animals
Genetic manipulation of the dopamine receptor, DRD2, markedly affects drug selfadministration
Low DRD2 levels might predispose an individual to use drugs to compensate for decreased activation of the reward circuit, whereas high DRD2 levels might be protective
Genetic upregulation of DRD2 receptors in rats reduces alcohol consumption, suggesting a target for treatment with drugs or environmental manipulations that increase DRD2 expression
The fact that many nonaddicted individuals also have low DRD2 levels suggests that low DRD2 only predisposes to addiction
Other behavioural traits or cognitive capacities unrelated to the dopaminergic reward pathway are also thought to influence vulnerability to addiction
Functional MRI imaging of individuals who are impulsive find differences in the corticolimbic behavioural arousal and control circuits that are affected by addiction (Brown et al., 2006)
Cognitive control is another relatively stable trait that is an important predictor of life success that plays an important role in the development of addiction (Eigsti et al., 2006)
Individuals with disorders of impulsivity such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or cognitive impairment are more likely to develop substance abuse disorders 49 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications (Lynskey and Hall, 2001)
There is also a high incidence of substance abuse among individuals with anxiety or depressive disorders in whom drug use may be a failed attempt to selfmedicate dysphoric (unpleasant) symptoms (Khantzian, 1985)
Chronic drug use can also produce anxiety and depressive disorders
The causal relationship between addictive and affective disorders can probably occur in both directions, and to varying degrees in different individuals
Neuropsychological research suggests that the brains of adolescents and young adults may be developmentally more vulnerable to addiction and substance abuse than those of older adults (Volkow and Li, 2005)
Mesocortical tracts that are involved in cognitive processing, executive control and motivation are not fully developed in the adolescent brain (Sowell et al., 2004) ( 12 )
In fact, the PFC does not fully mature until the early 20s (Gogtay et al., 2004)
The neuroanatomical connections between the amygdala and PFC — the circuit responsible for cognitive control over emotions — are not fully developed until adult life (Cunningham et al., 2002)
These observations have two major implications
First, as the regions of the brain responsible for impulse inhibition and reasoning about consequences are not fully developed, adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviours such as drug use, find it more difficult to inhibit impulses, engage in novelty seeking, and suffer from a temporal myopia that prevents a full appreciation of the future consequences of their behaviour (Volkow and Li, 2005)
Secondly, the developmental immaturity of the adolescent brain means that adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to the neurobiological changes that occur as the result of chronic drug use
Neuropsychological changes at such a developmentally sensitive period can reduce the individual's cognitive capacities in overcoming addiction
This could explain why epidemiological studies show that people who engage in substance abuse in early adolescence are more likely to develop addiction and less likely to recover than those who delay drug use until early adulthood
( I2 ) Myelinafion of the mesocortical tracts, a cellular process that enables neurons to signal quickly and efficiently, is not complete in the adolescent brain
50 Chapter 3 The treatment of addiction Adrian Carter, Wayne Hall and David Nutt Introduction Neuroscience research is uncovering the neurochemical mechanisms that produce the behavioural and cognitive problems observed in those with an addiction
This includes: the pharmacological sites at which drugs act (e.g
receptors); the neurochemicals involved in the metabolism (e.g
enzymes) and trafficking of drugs (e.g
transporters) that regulate their activity within the brain; and the molecular changes that occur in the brain as a result of continuous use of addictive drugs over long periods of time (see Chapter 2)
As our understanding of addiction deepens and becomes more detailed, it opens up the possibility for a wider range of powerful new technologies to treat and, more controversially, to prevent addiction
Because the neurobiological changes underpinning addiction can vary between individuals and over time, neuroscience may allow clinicians to target new treatments to the most appropriate individuals and at the most appropriate times
Addiction has traditionally been treated by a combination of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments
The most widely used and effective pharmacological treatments remain ones that were developed before the explosion of neuroscience research on addiction
These can be grouped into two types: (1) drugs that either block the addictive drug from working (e.g
naltrexone as relapse prevention for heroin dependence) or make its use unpleasant (e.g
disulfiram for alcohol dependence); or (2) drugs that replace the addictive drug with a less harmful version of the drug (e.g
substitution treatment using methadone and buprenorphine for heroin dependence, or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoked tobacco)
These treatments may be used as a shortterm measure to help wean individuals off all drugs (e.g
drugassisted withdrawal from opiates using clonidine) or they may be used over the longterm as either a replacement or prophylaxis against a return to the use of the (usually illicit) drug of abuse
Neurobiological research on addiction has provided a stronger rationale for the use of these pharmacological treatments of addiction
It is the impact that neuroscience has on our view of addiction, and those addicted, that may raise as many ethical and social concerns as the actual technologies themselves
As with any new technology, the way in which it is used will affect the benefit and harm that it produces
53 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Researchers are also developing new pharmacological approaches unlike those currently in use
These include drugs to enhance cognition and memory so addicted individuals can choose not to use drugs, and drugs that manipulate synaptic plasticity
Researchers are also developing novel immunological approaches, such as drug vaccines which bind to the drug and prevent it acting in the brain
Neurological techniques are also emerging as possibilities, such as deep brain stimulation of centres involved in reward and transcranial magnetic stimulation that applies electromagnetic currents to manipulate brain function and cognition
The advantages and disadvantages of each new method of treatment will need to be evaluated to establish their safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness and to identify any potential harms or misuses of these approaches
In addition to the novel pharmacological and neurological treatments discussed in this section, neuroscientists are currently studying 80 or so neurotransmitter, receptors, transporters and neural hormones from which new approaches to treating addiction may emerge (Hyman, 2005)
The therapeutic potential of these large number of new pharmacological targets for addiction treatment is yet to be realised
A great deal of research will be required before the safety and efficacy of these treatments can be evaluated and their potential impact on society assessed
While the emerging treatments offer the potential to significantly improve the outcome of addiction treatment and reduce the harm it causes, they also have the potential to be used in ways that raise ethical and social concerns that need to be carefully considered
Following on from Chapter 2, this section will describe a number of the most promising technologies emerging from neuroscientific research on addiction, how they are likely to be used, and their potential to be effective and to cause harm
The ethical and social implications of the use of these technologies will then be explored in Chapter 5
While psychosocial approaches to treatment are a vital aspect of addiction treatment, they will not be discussed at length in this report
The aim of this report is to analyse the potential impact on new technologies from neuroscientific and genetic research of addiction on European society
This omission should not be taken to suggest that psychosocial treatments are not effective or important in the treatment of addiction
They form an essential component of addiction treatment that will continue to be used in combination with new pharmacological approaches (EMCDDA, 2007b)
Successful addiction treatment will require combinations of behavioural strategies and drugs that remediate brain circuits damaged by drug abuse
This will require strategies to promote the plasticity of dysfunctional brain circuits, similar to those used to improve reading in children with learning disabilities and to rehabilitate adults after brain injury
Addiction psychopharmacology and treatment implications Advances in genomic and molecular biology, such as the ability to clone and sequence receptor subtypes, transporters and endogenous agonists, has significantly increased our ability to develop novel and specific treatments for addiction to a variety of 54 Chapter 3: The treatment of addiction substances
The pharmacokinetic sites of action for many drugs of abuse have been identified
For most of these drugs, the molecular sites of action are neurotransmitter receptors and transporters that regulate neurotransmitter activity at the synapse (Nutt, 1996; Iverson et al., 2007)
Drugs of abuse work by mimicking the effect of endogenous neurochemical signalling
For example, heroin produces its effect by mimicking the action of endogenous opioid neurochemicals (e.g
endorphins and enkephalins) (Nutt, 1996)
These discoveries have enabled scientists to identify and specifically target relevant receptor or transporter sites with drugs that either block (antagonists) or facilitate (agonists) activity at this site
Antagonists are typically those drugs which block the action of the addictive drug (e.g
naltrexone blocks the effect of heroin), while agonists are typically drugs which mimic the effect of the addictive drug
The use of agonists in substitution treatments (e.g
methadone for heroin dependence) and of antagonists in relapse prevention are discussed in greater detail below
The use of genetic manipulation techniques in animal models has also greatly increased our understanding of the functional role that these molecules play in the development of addiction
Genetic manipulation in a developing animal allows researchers to observe the effect of increasing (e.g
overexpression mutants) or blocking (e.g
transgenic knockouts or dominantnegative mutants) the activity of a specific molecule
These techniques help us to understand the role that these molecules play in the onset and progression to addiction, and in affecting responses to drug use; information that assist researchers in discovering potential new therapeutic agents
The advent of psychopharmacological neuroimaging techniques have also been invaluable in understanding the impact of functional changes within humans
Neuroimaging of addiction in humans has been critical in linking developments in animal research with our understanding of addiction in humans
By unravelling the various pharmacological processes that underpin the phenomenon of addiction, these discoveries have provided a number of novel and promising sites for intervention
These discoveries also point towards a more rational approach to addiction treatment, and to more encompassing theories of the brain mechanisms underlying addiction (Nutt, 1996; Nutt et al., 2007c)
Pharmacological treatments of addiction can be classified into those that: • block the target drug from binding to its site of action; • interfere with acute and chronic central dopaminergic response to addictive drugs; • interfere with other neurotransmitter systems related to the reward pathway (e.g
opioids, cannabinoids, glutamate/GABA, and the stress response); and • minimise the harmful effects of drug abuse
55 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Pharmacological treatments that block drug binding The traditional approach to the pharmacological treatment of addiction involves using drugs that interfere with or block the site at which the drug of addiction acts (e.g
muopioid receptor for heroin)
These medications have been most effective in the treatment of addiction to opioids (e.g
methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone)
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the most common form of substitution treatment, but is not particularly effective (up to 82 % relapse rates)
No agonists have proven effective in treating stimulant addiction (Hyman et al., 2006)
Opioid antagonists (e.g
naltrexone, nalmefene) have also been shown to have utility in preventing relapse in alcohol dependence (Volpicelli et al., 1995)
The use of antagonists to treat addiction has been less effective for addiction to stimulants, such as amphetamines and cocaine, possibly because the wrong antagonists have been used (only dopamine DRD2 antagonists are currently available for clinical use — see below)

56 Chapter 3: The treatment of addiction Different pharmacological agents have different sites of action and affect different neurotransmitter systems
All treatments which act by blocking the direct binding of the abused drug fall into one of three approaches: (1) agonist; (2) antagonist; and (3) partial agonist
These three approaches are described below
A detailed description of treatments for all drugs of addiction is beyond the scope of this report
However, a brief description of each approach, their potential for effective treatment, as well as their limitations is provided below
A summary of the most common drugs used in the treatment of addiction, and their primary action and application is provided in Table 1 (LingfordHughes and Nutt, 2003)
Agonists Agonists are drugs that act in a similar way on the same receptors as a drug of abuse and produce similar effects
Treatment involves replacing the abused drug with one that is: safer (less likely to produce adverse outcomes); has slower pharmacokinetics (meaning that it will bind for longer); or a stronger affinity for the receptor site (so it will not be readily shifted from the site by the abused drug)
The aim of treatment is to block the actions of the drug of addiction, providing some protection against the acute adverse effects of the drug (e.g
overdose in the case of heroin addiction)
These drugs should also have slow rates of brain uptake and clearance, thereby providing relatively stable and more enduring concentrations of dopamine in the brain (e.g
oral methadone)
The aim of agonist treatments is to replace the unsupervised use of an illicit drug (e.g
heroin) of unknown strength and purity, with a safer, pharmaceutical grade drug (e.g
methadone) in a regulated manner which offers the potential for support and education
The advantage of agonist treatments is that they reduce the incidence of acute adverse effects of drug use, such as overdose and the spread of BBV
Agonists can also prevent or minimise the symptoms of withdrawal, and reduce craving for the drug of addiction, which leads to greater retention in treatment programmes and increased treatment compliance
Agonists are often used in substitution treatment programmes where the aim of treatment is longterm maintenance
The most well known is methadone maintenance therapy (MMT)
Agonists may also be prescribed for shorter periods to help addicts become abstinent by reducing the symptoms of withdrawal
Agonists have a number of social advantages as well, in that they reduce the incidence of drugrelated social harm, such as crime, theft and violence
The disadvantage of agonists is that they have the potential to cause similar harm as the abused drug, especially if they are used in large doses or diverted to the black market and used by drug naTve individuals who lack the drug tolerance of chronic drug users
Agonist treatments are therefore provided under strict controls and restrictions which can make treatment difficult and unattractive (e.g
daily supervised dosing)
Also, because agonists produce a similar reinforcing effect to the target drug, they are also addictive (e.g
methadone and buprenorphine for heroin dependence)
57 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Agonist substitution has not been as successful in the treatment of addiction to stimulants, except for comorbid treatment of ADHD
This is most likely because the agonist has to block nearly all of the dopamine agonist transporter (DAT) in order to interfere with cocaine's effects, or may reflect the importance of changes in other neurotransmitter systems such as norepinephrine
Drugs which increase dopamine can also cause additional health problems, particularly concerning the heart, and they can be abused
Opponents of the prescription of agonists also argue that this leads to increases in illicit drug use by sending a message that recreational drug use is an appropriate behaviour and reducing the deterrent effect of punitive drug policies
There is very little reliable evidence to support either of these claims
Antagonists Antagonists are drugs that bind to the pharmacological site of action but do not produce the reinforcing effects of the addictive drug or its agonists
Antagonists work by blocking the receptor sites at which the drug of addiction acts (e.g
naltrexone for heroin addiction), thereby reducing its rewarding effect
Antagonists must also be: safe; have a long halflife (meaning that they remain bound in the brain for long periods, reducing the dose frequency), and; possess a strong affinity for the receptor site so that they cannot be easily shifted by the drug of addiction
Antagonists are most often employed as a prophylaxis against relapse because they block the reinforcing effect of addictive drugs as long as they are taken (see below)
The advantage of antagonists is that they are generally safer than agonists when used as intended; they are not reinforcing or addictive; and they can also reduce acute adverse effects of the abused drug (e.g
overdoses)
Their safer profile means that they can be provided with fewer controls and regulations than agonists
A problem with antagonists is that they can precipitate withdrawal symptoms because they block the activity of the drug of addiction
Thus, initiating their use requires that addicts have not been detoxified and are drug free
Because antagonists do not have any rewarding effect, people often stop taking them and then relapse to drug use, with a higher risk of a drug overdose in the case of opiates because users are no longer tolerant to opiates
New slowrelease formulations of these drugs (e.g
naltrexone implants that reportedly last between one and six months) have been developed in order to overcome these compliance issues
These treatments are often promoted for use in some form of coerced treatment (Caplan, 2006), a practice that raises a number of ethical concerns that will be discussed in Chapter 5 (see pp
9399)
Partial agonists Partial agonists are drugs that bind to the site of action and produce less of a reinforcing effect than full agonists (e.g
buprenorphine for opioid dependence, varenicline for nicotine)
Like their pharmacological cousins, partial agonists must have a long halflife and a strong affinity for the binding site in order to block the effects of the addicted 58 Chapter 3: The treatment of addiction drug
Partial agonists also possess many of the advantages of both the full agonists and antagonists and so may provide an effective form of treatment that will benefit both society and the individual
More empirical data is required on their safety and efficacy
The main advantage of partial agonists is that as they have some reinforcing effects they are therefore more likely to retain people in treatment than antagonists
As their agonistic effects are minor, they are much less likely to cause acute adverse effects
Their safer profile also means that they can be provided under less prohibitive restrictions than full agonists: they can be given in larger doses, and may be provided with less supervision and with takeaway doses
They also provide some protection against the harmful effects of the drug of addiction such as overdose
Despite these positive features, partial agonists do pose a number of risks
As they produce a small agonist effect, they can still produce overdoses and they are addictive
It is also not clear yet whether partial agonists are as effective in reducing illicit drug use as full agonists (LingfordHughes et al., 2004)
Partial agonists may not be as effective as full agonists in reducing the urge to use a drug of abuse in some individuals because of their attenuated rewarding effects
It is important that the partial agonists are used with care, and that each is evaluated on its merits
Treatment aims and philosophy Agonists and partial agonists may be given for greatly varying lengths of time, depending upon the philosophical aims of the treatment programme
Pharmacological treatments may be used over short periods of time to assist addicted individuals to withdraw from their target drug
This is often referred to as detoxification
The aim of detoxification is to achieve abstinence from all drugs
Agonists or partial agonists may also be used for longer periods to encourage less harmful forms of drug use as substitution treatment (also referred to as replacement or maintenance therapy)
Treatments that primarily aim to reduce the harm associated with illicit drug use (also referred to as harm minimisation or harm reduction) involve the use of other rewarding or reinforcing drugs
Substitution treatment for opioid dependence, using either methadone or buprenorphine, is commonly available in Europe and generally considered an important element in the response to this type of drug problem
However, historically this approach has been considered controversial and sometimes viewed as condoning drug use
This view still persists at least to a limited extent in some countries today, although substitution treatment for opioid problems is available in nearly every EU Member State (EMCDDA, 2008)
A longer term form of addiction drug treatment that has not generally been regarded as controversial is the use of antagonists for relapse prevention
The aim of relapse prevention is to prevent the use of any recreational drugs, rather than reducing their harm
It is therefore more acceptable to those who believe that treatment programmes that offer any form of rewarding drug are immoral and send the wrong 'message' to society about drug use
59 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications These different treatment approaches lie along a continuum of treatment philosophy from abstinence to harm minimisation, with drugfree detoxification at one end and agonist maintenance for harm minimisation at the other
Harm reduction strategies also include some of the newer approaches to treating addiction, such as reducing the toxic effects of chronic drug use or finding safer forms of drugs to use (see pp
11720)
The growing acceptance of the view that addiction is a chronic disease has seen a shift in research towards approaches that aim to treat addicted individuals over a long period
This approach is not always well reflected in social policies towards addiction that sometimes still focus on abstinence in the short term as a primary goal
Pharmacological treatments targeting the dopaminergic response to drugs Drugs which target the dopaminergic system have not yet proven effective in treating addiction
This may be because drugs used so far have targeted the wrong dopamine receptor (e.g
DRD2)
New treatments may also need to consider changes in other modulatory neurotransmitter systems
The central role that dopamine plays in a range of behaviours and cognition has always meant that it would be difficult to develop an effective dopaminergic drug to treat addiction that did not also produce serious adverse side effects
The use of agonists to treat addiction to stimulants (by binding to the DAT in order to increase dopamine activity) has been unsuccessful
The DRD2 selective agonists tested have not proven effective
Pharmacological agents targeted at the other dopamine receptors appear more promising
Preliminary studies of the dopamine receptor 1 (DRD1) agonists have been promising (Baler and Volkow, 2006), as has a partial agonist of the dopamine receptor 3 (DRD3) in treating cocaine dependence (Pilla et al., 1999; Lingford Hughes and Nutt, 2003)
Another approach to treat addiction has been to block the acute dopaminergic response to addictive drugs by blocking dopamine receptors
Neuroleptic drugs (traditionally used in the treatment of schizophrenia) that block the DRD2 receptor reduce the reinforcing effects of drugs in animal models (Hyman, 2005), but this effect has not yet been reproduced in human addicts
Neuroleptics are also not well tolerated by addicts who are particularly sensitive to the extrapyramidal effects of DRD2 blockers, (e.g
disorders of movement and motor control such as those seen in Parkinson's disease) (Hyman, 2005)
Given the role that dopamine plays in everyday motivation, blocking DRD2 receptors is also likely to decrease sensitivity to natural reinforcers
One drug that affects dopamine activity and has proven effective in the treatment of nicotine addiction is bupropion (Zyban) (Jorenby et al., 1999)
Its exact mechanism of action is still uncertain although it appears to act by inhibiting the uptake of dopamine and noradrenaline (Ascher et al., 1995)
Bupropion is also a nicotine receptor antagonist
Clinical trials are under way to investigate the use of bupropion in the treatment of methamphetamine addiction
60 Chapter 3: The treatment of addiction Pharmacological interventions in systems related to the reward pathway Given the mixed results from directly interfering with dopamine, an alternative approach has been developed to target related neurotransmitter systems that are involved in reward (LingfordHughes and Nutt, 2003)
These related circuits indirectly affect the reward pathway by: regulating either dopamine cell firing or the release of dopamine in the NAcc (e.g
opioids, and the amino acids, glutamate and GABA); or interfering with the postsynaptic response to dopamine stimulation (e.g
cannabinoids) (Iverson et al., 2007)
Interventions in these processes provide some novel and promising treatments to emerge from neuroscience research
More empirical data is required before the safety and efficacy of these potential treatments can be established
Pharmacological interventions in each of these related systems are discussed below
Opioids Recent research has suggested that changes in the opioid system play an important role in all forms of addiction, not just opiate addiction
There are three receptor subtypes that mediate the effects of endogenous opiates
Neuroimaging studies suggest that changes in the mu opiate receptor levels may be fundamental in addiction (Zubieta et al., 2000)
The kappa receptor may also play a role
Stimulation of kappa receptors reduces dopamine release in the NAcc that may be responsible for feelings of dysphoria
Delta antagonists reduce selfadministration of alcohol in rats, and so may play an important role in reinforcement (LingfordHughes and Nutt, 2003)
The fact that naltrexone is effective in the treatment of addiction to substances other than opiates highlights the role that the opioid system plays in addiction
As discussed previously, naltrexone is a longacting opioid receptor antagonist which blocks the effect of opiates like heroin
Naltrexone has been shown to be effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence, probably because it blocks the actions of endogenous endorphins that are released by alcohol (Herz, 1997)
Naltrexone has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of obesity (addiction to food) (Volkow and Wise, 2005) and gambling
It is one of a number of anticraving drugs that have become a focus for research (O'Brien, 2005) and that are being promoted as effective treatments for addiction
The amino acid neurotransmitters: Glutamate and GABA Many of the neuroadaptations that occur in addiction involve changes in the prefrontal cortex that have numerous connections with the dopaminergic reward pathway
Activity in these cortical circuits is mediated by the amino acid neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA
These neurochemicals accordingly represent promising targets for pharmacological intervention
Studies have begun to look at whether drugs that act on these systems reduce drug selfadministration in animals (Kalivas and Volkow, 2005)
Treatments which affect the glutamate and GABA systems may also prove effective in the treatment of stimulant addiction, which has been largely resistant to existing pharmacological treatment approaches
61 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications The amino acid, glutamate, is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain
The glutamatergic system is well placed to influence dopamine signalling because its neurons in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala make reciprocal connections with the dopaminergic mesolimbic reward pathway
The glutamate receptor, NmethylDaspartic acid (NMDA), appears to play a particularly important role in addiction to nicotine, cannabis, alcohol and benzodiazepines (Wolf, 1998; LingfordHughes and Nutt, 2003)
Antagonists of the NMDA receptor inhibit sensitisation to stimulants and the development of opioid dependence (Trujillo and Akil, 1995; LingfordHughes and Nutt, 2003)
Cotreatment with the NMDA blocker, dizocilpine, also attenuates tolerance to opioids (Trujillo and Akil, 1991)
There also appears to be a compensatory increase in the numbers of glutamate receptors in alcohol addiction that may explain the hyperexcitability seen in alcohol withdrawal
Acamprosate, a drug shown to be effective in treating the withdrawal symptoms of alcohol addiction, decreases glutamate release (O'Brien, 2005)
Not all NMDA antagonists are clinically useful because some produce hallucinations and psychotic symptoms
Nacetylcystein (NAC), an activator of cystineglutamate exchange, is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials for cocaine dependence (LaRowe et al., 2006)
GABAenhancing drugs maintain abstinence by preventing cue and druginduced increases in dopamine
Two antiepileptic drugs have shown promise in this area
Topiramate shows promise in treating alcohol, opiate and cocaine addiction (Kampman et al., 2004; Myrick and Anton, 2004; Zullino et al., 2005), while another antiepileptic, gamma vinyl GABA (vigabatrin) might also be effective (Brodie et al., 2005)
Baclofen, a muscle relaxant which acts via the GABAB receptor, has been shown to reduce the reinforcing effects of amphetamines and to reduce cocaine selfadministration in rats (Campbell et al., 2002; Brebner et al., 2005)
As discussed above (see pp
3840), glutamate, and to a lesser extent GABA, are involved in the molecular processes, such as LTP and LTD, that are responsible for the synaptic changes that maintain addiction
Neuroscientists are also currently investigating the signalling molecules within each neuron that produce the internal cellular processes that lead to synaptic plasticity, such gene expression or gene upregulation, protein synthesis and protein trafficking (Calabresi et al., 2007)
The molecules that sustain these processes may yet prove to be significant targets for the treatment of addiction, by helping to reverse or ameliorate the neuroadaptations associated with addiction (Calabresi et al., 2007)
A great deal of research is required before this hope may be realised, but it holds significant promise, particularly for addictions that do not yet have an effective pharmacological target
Cannabinoids The cannabinoid receptor (CB1) system is believed to be involved in the neural processes underlying reward, learning and memory, suggesting that it might also be a potential pharmacological target in the treatment of addiction
Drugs which act on the cannabinoid system have recently been shown to reduce the reinforcing effects of various drugs 62 Chapter 3: The treatment of addiction of abuse
The CB1 cannabinoid receptor modulates dopamine cells and postsynaptic responses from dopamine stimulation, and can therefore influence the reinforcing effects of drugs
The CB1 antagonist, Rimonabant, appears to attenuate the reinforcing effects of various drugs of abuse
Rimonabant was originally developed as a treatment against schizophrenia, as cannabis can lead to psychosis, and later obesity and the metabolic syndrome (Van Goal et al., 2005)
Preclinical studies suggest that it may also be effective for the treatment of nicotine addiction (Le Foil and Goldberg, 2005)
Pharmacological treatments for chronic changes in dopamine activity Chronic drug use also produces neuroadaptations in other neural systems that can significantly affect an individual's ability to refrain from using drugs (Baler and Volkow, 2006)
There has consequently been an increased effort in recent years to develop pharmacological treatments that ameliorate these neuroadaptive changes
Given that these changes affect cognitive processes such as executive control, memory and conditioned response, and responses to stress, these drugs may be more effective when combined with cognitive behavioural therapy
Corticotropin releasing factor stress response Since stress is a potent trigger for relapse, dampening the stress response may be a way of reducing relapse to drug use (Bruijnzeel and Gold, 2005)
The stress response is mediated by CRF in the HPA axis and amygdala
Drugs, such as CRF antagonists, which can interfere with the stress response may prevent relapse
Drugs which block CRF activity have been shown in animals to block the initiation of drug use and stressinduced reinstatement of drug seeking behaviour for a variety of drugs (Koob, 1999; Koob and Le Moal, 2005; Baler and Volkow, 2006)
Dynorphin is another molecule in the stress pathway that is being targeted
Oxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone that is involved in the formation of relationships (Pitman et al., 1993; Insel, 2003; Heinrichs and Gaab, 2007) and the development of trust (Kosfeld et al., 2005; Domes et al., 2007a; Domes et al., 2007b)
Recent research has suggested that it may be a possible target in the treatment of addiction (Kovacs et al., 1984; Sarnyai and Kovacs, 1994; Kovacs et al., 1998; Sarnyai, 1998)
Oxytocin is released by the posterior pituitary and has been shown to reduce stress, dampen HPA activity (Kovacs and Telegdy, 1988; Devries et al., 2007), and reduce dopamine transmission
Oxytocin also inhibits the development of tolerance to addictive drugs and reduces the symptoms of withdrawal from morphine in rats (Kovacs et al., 1984; Kovacs et al., 1998)
Memory manipulators and cognitive enhancers Pharmacological treatments which either enhance or dampen memories associated with drug use have also been investigated as addiction treatments
The use of the adrenergic beta blocker, propranolol, interferes with the formation and recall of emotionally salient 63 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications memories, and may be effective in the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Pitman et al., 2002)
Propranolol may also prove to be effective in reducing conditioned responses to drugs such as cocaine (Kampman et al., 2001; Milekic et al., 2006)
Memory enhancers have been suggested as an adjunct to psychotherapy because of the effectiveness of a similar approach in the treatment of phobias
Drugs which improve alertness and attention, such as modafinil, a drug used to treat narcolepsy, have been suggested as treatments for stimulant addiction
Modafinil appears promising in the treatment of cocaine addiction (Dackis et al., 2005) (')
The development of effective treatments for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases which increase memory and attention, may also provide novel approaches to the treatment of stimulant addiction (e.g
ampakines)
Pharmacological approaches to minimise the harmful effects of drug use Research is under way to develop new forms of drugs which reduce the toxic or harmful effects of drug use (e.g
toxicity of alcohol for liver and neural tissue)
Nutt (2006), for example, has suggested that neuroscientists should develop a less toxic, water soluble GABAagonist that would produce the euphoric effects of alcohol without its neurotoxic and hepatotoxic sideeffects (Nutt, 2006b)
An analogous approach has been suggested with tobacco harm reduction in which cigarette smokers would be encouraged to switch from smoking to much less hazardous oral tobacco products, such as snus (Gartner et al., 2007)
Snus has been treated to remove the primary carcinogens and because it is orally consumed, has a substantially reduced incidence of adverse health effects (e.g
lung cancer)
To date, these approaches remain controversial and it is likely that there would be considerable opposition to any attempt to market a safer alternative to illicit drugs like heroin or cocaine
An alternative approach to harm reduction is using other drugs to mitigate the acute negative effects of particular drugs of abuse
One suggestion is to use drugs to prevent memory loss associated with alcohol intoxication (Nutt, 2006b)
A similar strategy is used in the prescription of combined pharmacological treatments of addiction with the aim of reducing the abuse potential of the treatment
One example is the combination of a small dose of an opioid antagonist, naloxone, with buprenorphine (marketed as Suboxone) to reduce injecting use of the diverted drug
Because of its low oral biodisponibility (3 to 10 %) naloxone does not affect the reinforcing properties of buprenorphine when taken orally but precipitates withdrawal if the product is injected
It remains to be seen if this will prove effective
A summary of all the main treatments for drug addiction in use or development are listed in Table 2
Modafinil, while not addictive, has an abuse liability

65 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Novel approaches to drug treatment Immunotherapies Immunotherapies represent a new strategy in the development of addiction treatment
These are in the form of vaccines against the effects of nicotine, cocaine and heroin that act by binding to the target drug in the bloodstream and preventing it from reaching the brain
Drug vaccines are primarily intended to be used in relapse prevention but the term 'vaccine' also raises expectations about their potential use to prevent drug addiction when used as a prophylactic treatment (e.g
in combination with genetic screening of adolescents for addiction susceptibility)
The effectiveness of such an approach is uncertain and even if successful, it would raise a number of ethical concerns that will be addressed in Chapter 5 (see pp
11114)
Depot or slow release formulations Researchers are developing implantable slow release or longacting formulations of naltrexone and buprenorphine
This will make it possible to reduce dosing from a daily event to a monthly or even halfyearly implantation, overcoming the problems of poor compliance with antagonists and diversion of agonists and partial agonists if take away doses are given
Implantable antagonists are a particularly attractive option for proponents of legally coerced treatment of addiction
Neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation A novel, so far rarely used, treatment for addiction is neurosurgical ablation of brain structures implicated in addiction
Neuroscientists in Russia and China have used neuroscience research of the effects of chronic drug use on the nucleus accumbens and the cingulate gyrus to justify the stereotactic ablation of these regions (Gao et al., 2003; Medvedev et al., 2003)
Neurosurgery is the most invasive and permanent form of treatment used and is often only considered appropriate in a few severe conditions where there are few options which have been tried unsuccessfully
It is generally considered a treatment of last resort, requiring careful consideration (Valenstein, 1973; Valenstein, 1986; Hall, 2006)
The ethical implications of the social and political context in which these treatments have been used will be discussed in subsequent sections
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is another form of neurosurgery that has been suggested as a treatment of addiction (BBC News, 2007)
It involves the insertion of electrical stimulating electrodes deep into the brain regions involved in addiction, such as the insula
When the electrodes are stimulated, activity in these areas can be manipulated
The use of DBS in these areas has so far only been trialled in obsessive compulsive disorder (Gabriels et al., 2003), although DBS has been used in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease and is currently being trialled in the treatment of depression
While this treatment is not as damaging as ablative neurosurgery, it does present considerable 66 Chapter 3: The treatment of addiction risks and can result in permanent damage
The side effects of this novel treatment are also unknown
Some patients with Parkinson's Disease who have been treated with DBS have developed impulsive behaviours that appear similar to impulse disorders (Frank et al., 2007)
A patent has also been placed on the use of intracranial (vagal) nerve stimulation as a treatment for addiction
Transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a far less invasive treatment that involves placing a small magnetic coil against an individual's skull in order to block or enhance neural activity in a particular cortical region (Machii et al., 2006)
The coil produces a strong magnetic field that can change neuronal electrical activity (PascualLeone et al., 2002)
By manipulating cortical activity, it is hoped that TMS might prove to be a useful treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders, including addiction (Ridding and Rothwell, 2007)
TMS raises fewer health and safety concerns than neurosurgery or DBS because it does not involve physical penetration of neural tissue (Anand and Hotson, 2002)
However, it has been shown to cause psychotic and epileptic symptoms in a minority of patients (Wassermann, 1998; Machii et al., 2006)
TMS is capable of producing significant behavioural changes
Studies have shown that a session of TMS can have a significant impact on the decisions individuals make (Fecteau et al., 2007), and may enhance cognition and memory (llles et al., 2006a)
A recent pilot study has shown that a session of high frequency repetitive stimulation of the right prefrontal cortex can reduce craving in cocaineaddicted subjects (Camprodon et al., 2007)
This technique appears promising but requires more research to evaluate its safety and efficacy
Neuroimaging for prevention and treatment of addiction Neuroimaging using fMRI, PET, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalograph (MEG), and electroencephalograph (EEG) are noninvasive techniques that enable researchers to identify functional and structural abnormalities in the brains of addicted individuals
Neuroimaging has played a critical role in increasing understanding of the neurobiology of addiction
It has been suggested that these techniques might also be used in preventing addiction and developing more effective treatments (Volkow and Li, 2005)
As with genetic screening, neuroimaging might be used to identify neuropsychological vulnerabilities that predispose some individuals to developing addiction if they abuse drugs (e.g
poorly functioning inhibitory control circuits)
Neuroimaging may also help to identify neuropsychological deficits that are the primary source of an individual's inability to stop using drugs (e.g
enhanced salience, poor executive control)
This would allow clinicians to target specific pharmacological treatments to individuals that would hopefully have a better chance of success
67 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Psychosocial treatment of addiction Psychosocial interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing, drug counselling, and 12step support groups provide an important adjunct to pharmacological and medical treatments in achieving a longterm successful outcome
While psychosocial treatments are outside the scope of this report, it is important to acknowledge the need for greater attention and investment in psychosocial treatment and research
Advances in neuroscience and cognitive psychology showing cognitive deficits in impulse inhibition and a pathological focus on drug use in addiction highlight the importance of psychosocial therapies that aim to ameliorate these cognitive deficits (Volkow and Li, 2005)
Neuroscience may also help in designing therapies which are more effective for addicted individuals with particular kinds of cognitive deficits
The neuroscience of addiction vulnerability during adolescence may assist in driving social policies for dealing with addiction, such as prohibitions on alcohol and tobacco use in minors, and the importance of early education on the dangers of drug use
One particular ethical concern in relation to psychosocial treatments of addiction is that simplistic brain disease models may lead to the neglect of psychosocial approaches in favour of more biological approaches to treatment, sometimes referred to as 'medicalisation'
This concern will be discussed in Chapter 5 (see pp
10609)
68 Chapter 4 Human rights, ethical values and the implications of current addiction research Benjamin Capps and Richard Ashcroft Introduction Ethics is the domain of inquiry whose task it is to formulate and interpret the most appropriate principles to guide human conduct
These philosophical and applied enquiries, when related to neuroscience, have been termed 'neuroethics', although the methods of analysis and theoretical frameworks used in these inquiries are not unique to this field
There is a bewildering diversity of approaches to this task, resulting in a wide variety of ethical theories which purport to provide rationales for common moral rules (Rachels, 1999; Beauchamp and Childress, 2001)
Policy rarely appeals directly to any single moral position; and for this reason, it is possibly unwise to rely only on any one doctrine (and all its many manifestations) to shape ethical analyses of the implications of research on addiction neurobiology
The basis of European bioethics has been characterised by at least three ethical approaches which have presided over the debates: human rights, dignity and utilitarianism
In this report, it is suggested that the first of these — human rights — has a particular prominence in EU policy
Such an approach is not without controversy, and there are two principal debates in this regard: the moral basis of human rights and the role of government in applying such principles
Such debates are beyond the scope of this report, which intends to present the ethical arguments in respect to neuroethics
From a human rights perspective, the following principles could be taken to be requirements for treatment to be regarded as ethical: 1) There should be rigorous evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the treatment that is provided; 2) Effective treatment should be provided safely in wellstructured, wellresourced and wellmanaged treatment programmes; 3) Human rights law should be clearly understood and prioritised over the competing claims of the public interest
A balance must be found between these competing claims and this should be expressed in the ethical values of autonomy, liberty, privacy and consent; 71 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications 4) Restricting individual rights in the public interest must only be done for compelling reasons based on empirical, clinical and scientific evidence; 5) Policies should observe the ethical values of respecting patients' autonomy by defining the constraints of their liberty and by ensuring that they give free and informed consent to participate in treatment, protecting their privacy of information; 6) Treatment programmes should ensure that dependent persons have equitable access to treatment which maximises its effectiveness for each individual (by matching patients to the treatment that meets their individual needs and situation), and ensures that they do not bear a disproportionate social burden in accepting treatment; 7) It is important that pharmacological treatment should not be used to compensate for poor social policies that lead some to drug abuse and addiction, contribute to a general erosion of human rights, or inappropriate 'public interest' drug policies that may be overfocused on the negative and criminal impact of drug addiction
Ethics and addiction The promise of neuroscience and genetic research raises major ethical and social issues (Safire, 2002; Hall et al., 2004b; Farah, 2005; llles, 2006; Ashcroft et al., 2007)
These can be considered under two broad headings: (1) ethical issues that arise from neuroscience and genetic research on addiction; and (2) the broader social and ethical implications of the potential technological applications of neuroscience (e.g
for therapeutic, preventive, and enhancement purposes)
This part of the report is concerned with (1)
In Chapter 5, questions arising under (2) are discussed in respect to the novel developments in addiction neuroscience and genetics that may impact upon the treatment and prevention of addiction, and policies to reduce drug use
Various ethical approaches have been applied to locate and reflect on the ethical issues in neuroscience research, and to frame and justify policy responses
A number of ethical values have emerged as being fundamental in balancing individual and public interests; and of particular importance have been issues of autonomy, liberty, privacy, consent and equality
These ethical values may be framed within a broad conception of human rights, and by balancing such rights with the public interests, a framework may be developed which can inform our responses to addiction and the emerging findings from current research
A possible framework is suggested in the box on p
74
The sections that follow explore how these highlighted ethical values are affected by the key role of choice in drug use, and the possible ways in which the environment and genes affect an addict's neuropsychological capacity for decisionmaking, as understood by addiction neuroscience
In modern liberal democracies there tends to be an emphasis on the public good; this involves a proportional response to addicts' behaviour
For example, policies 72 Chapter 4: Human rights, ethical values and the implications of current addiction research entirely based on the 'moral' or 'sceptical' model may not take into account the social circumstances of drug use, the lack of effectiveness of punitive measures, and the benefits of treatment and reintegration
On the other hand, the 'medical' model may be used to downplay the criminal behaviour of some drug users
Therefore, while autonomy is a guiding premise in respecting the rights of individuals, individuals do not have rights to do as they please; their actions must be guided by responsibility towards others
Thus, in some situations, where individuals are incapable of controlling their actions, or acting in a way which may harm themselves or others, punitive measures may be justified
However, given the complexity of drug addiction, the scientific evidence would strongly point to the need for a balanced use of the medical model with other perspectives when considering which policy options are appropriate
This would ensure that both human rights and the public good are both adequately protected (see box below)
Developing a balanced drug policy Developments in neuroscience suggest that a balanced approach is required in addiction policies
The justification for such an approach is grounded in the medical model of addiction and the requirement for punitive measures
Currently, policies tend to be often weighted towards the deployment of criminal responses to addiction
On the one hand, most states have laws that prohibit adults from using cannabis, cocaine, and heroin
These laws are justified on paternalistic grounds that they prevent adults from harming themselves or others
On the other hand, if one accepts that paternalism is sometimes ethically acceptable (e.g
if one supports compulsory seatbelt laws or the regulation of pharmaceutical drugs), a major ethical problem remains in explaining why adults are permitted to use other substances, like alcohol and nicotine, which also cause a great deal of harm to users (Husak, 2004)
There is no obvious neurobiological justification for the fact that some psychoactive substances are legal while others are not (Ashcroft et al., 2007)
Nor does the legal status of these drugs necessarily directly correspond to the relative harms caused by their current levels of use (Room, 2007)
Some neuroscientists (e.g
Blakemore, 2002; Iversen, 2002; Nutt, 2006a; Iverson et al., 2007; Nutt et al., 2007b) are hopeful that their research will facilitate the development of policies towards drugs that reflect their prevalence of use and their capacity to harm users and others
The extent to which developments in this direction are likely, however, is questionable in the current context of strong policy support for the international drug control conventions and considerable opposition in most developed societies to any liberalisation of policies towards illicit drugs
Indeed, arguably it can be more easily imagined that advances in addiction neuroscience could be selectively used to justify more coercive policies towards illicit drug use in the name of preventing adolescents from acquiring a 'chronic brain disease'
73 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Taking all of the possible developments in neuroscience together, it is evident that an increasing influence of a 'global' economy on the development, manufacture and supply of drugs by 'online' and smallscale 'garage' agents make simple ethical choices difficult
These developments are likely to pose an important challenge for both European and interregional regulatory policies
This shift of focus from traditional sources of drug research and development, such as 'visible' biotech companies, to manufacturers and suppliers of illicit drugs, such as international cartels and 'garage' industries within the expansion of global markets, such as the Internet, is likely to challenge traditional approaches to regulation (Reidenberg, 1996)
Longestablished approaches which focus on drug trafficking control are likely to be increasingly challenged by these novel and more 'invisible' supply networks
Furthermore, attitudes based on the harm caused by drugs could potentially also be challenged by the development of 'safer' or non addictive substances (Prinz, 1997)
Drugcontrol policies may therefore be required to confront the need of putting into place a regulatory framework for the development, evaluation and use of novel drugs
This would involve questions of whether regulation is effective, legitimate and if its design is optimal (Brownsword, 2004)
To some extent this problem is already developing as regulators are increasingly faced with the problem of distinguishing between products sold often over the Internet as food supplements, alternative medicines, cognitive enhancers and even legal and supposedly 'safer' alternatives to illicit drugs (EMCDDA, 2008)
Human rights framework for addiction policy Human Rights 1) Protection and provision of necessary goods required for human life (e.g
health, housing) 2) Procedural rights to allow fair representation under law and to lead one's life free from arbitrary constraints: e.g
(from the ECHR) Right to a Fair Trial, Right to Equal Treatment
Ethical Values 1) Autonomy Refers to a person's capacity for selfdetermination
2) Liberty Condition in which an individual has the ability to act according to his or her own will within a coercive — but stabilising — framework of law
3) Privacy Ability of an individual or group to keep their lives and personal affairs out of public view, or to control the flow of information about themselves
74 Chapter 4: Human rights, ethical values and the implications of current addiction research 4) Consent Intentional mediation of relationships with one another or to put in place new relationships, and to signal their intentions and wishes
5) Equality Equal treatment by the law and in medical care
The Public Interest Referring to the 'general welfare', contrasts with individual interest (protected as human rights), under the assumption that what is good for society may not be directly good for a given individual and vice versa
Autonomy in addiction By definition, addiction is a disorder in which an individual's control over their drug use is impaired
People with an addiction continue to use drugs in the face of enormous negative consequences and despite often expressing a wish that they could stop
This perspective is codified in the diagnostic criteria for substance dependence or addiction, in which a loss of control over drug use is central, and drug use is compulsive and at the expense of all other goaldirected activities, such as working or caring for children (World Health Organization, 1993b; American Psychiatric Association, 2000)
This definition of addiction is contested by some commentators who are sceptical about the existence of addiction and see drug use as a decision that users make (see Chapter 1: 'Sceptical versus medical models of addiction', p
25) (Szasz, 1975; Dalrymple, 2006; Satel and Lilenfeld, 2007)
The effect of drug use and addiction on autonomy is of fundamental importance to this debate which, as discussed in Chapter 4, is also central to the expression of one's rights
Autonomy is becoming increasingly more important in research on addiction (Levy, 2006)
For much of the 20th century, drugdependent persons were seen as autonomous, self governing individuals who wilfully, knowingly, and voluntarily engaged in criminal and immoral behaviour (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990; Peele, 1998; White, 1998)
As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, the presumed autonomy and responsibility of such individuals has been called into question by recent genetic and neuroscientific research on addiction (Leshner, 1997; Volkow and Li, 2004)
It is increasingly argued, most notably by the directors of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA), who fund a significant proportion of all current research on addiction, that addiction is a 'chronic, relapsing brain disease' (Leshner, 1997, p
45)
The brain disease model of addiction challenges the traditional belief that drug use is always a voluntary choice by arguing that prolonged drug use results in longlasting 75 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications changes in brain structure and function that undermine voluntary control (Leshner, 1997; Volkow and Li, 2004)
These neuroadaptations can persist for months — possibly years — after abstinence and may explain why many abstinent drug addicts relapse (Volkow and Li, 2004)
Neurocognitive studies have also shown that addicted individuals display cognitive deficits in decisionmaking tasks (Jentsch and Taylor, 1999; Grant et al., 2000; Bechara, 2001; Rogers and Robbins, 2001; Fillmore, 2003; Hester and Garavan, 2004; Bechara, 2005; Yucel and Lubman, 2007)
A more detailed discussion of this research can be found in Chapter 2 of this report
These results are used to support a neurobiological account of how addictive drugs subvert endogenous reward circuits that are essential to survival, thereby giving drug use an overriding motivational salience that works to the detriment of all other goaldirected activities (Dackis and O'Brien, 2005)
According to proponents of the medical model, these brain changes also explain why addicts continue to use drugs despite tolerance to their pleasurable effects and in the face of serious adverse consequences
The 'chronic and relapsing brain disease model of addiction' therefore suggests that addicts have difficulty in understanding or considering the longterm consequences of drug use and have a diminished ability to control their drug use as a result of neuropharmacological changes in their brains
Although extreme, if taken literally, the 'chronic and relapsing brain disease model' could be used to argue that those with an addiction lack the autonomy to make informed choices about drug use (informed consent)
As some researchers have suggested (see box p
77), the choice to enter treatment or to participate in research (Cohen, 2002; Charland, 2002) can be referred to as informed consent
This model could also be used to justify the inappropriate use of coerced treatment (see pp
9399), the use of treatments whose proponents are overly optimistic about their ability to 'cure' addiction, or the use of highly invasive treatments, such as neurosurgery (see box p
108)
It may also encourage a reliance on medical or biological approaches to treatment, referred to as 'medicalisation' (see pp
106109) at the expense of possibly more effective psychological or social policies to tackle drug use
The impact that addiction neuroscience is having on our understanding about these issues is discussed below
Neurobiological research on addiction has significant contributions to make in understanding whether addicts are autonomous or not, and therefore responsible for their actions (see box p
77 for an example of this)
The debatable status of addicts before the law has thrown open a complex response to their criminal activities: both in consuming (and continuing to do so) an illicit drug and in engaging in criminal behaviour while intoxicated or in order to fund drug use
Criminal responses to drug use differ between the Member States (')
A large part of the debate concerns the addict's capacities, such as capacity to consent, or to take responsibility for their actions
Responses have varied C) See the EMCDDA website for uptodate information on current drug policies of the Member States: http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/ 76 Chapter 4: Human rights, ethical values and the implications of current addiction research between the treatment of addiction as a medical condition and criminal justice approaches which assume that drug users should take responsibility (and pay) for their 'choices'
At the start of this report it was emphasised that the 'medical' and 'moral' models have a large part to play in the development of appropriate responses to addiction
It is clear from the neuroscience of addiction that decisionmaking is impaired by addiction
However, it is generally not so impaired that those addicted lack autonomy, or forfeit their ability to express their liberty by virtue of the fact that they are addicted
Policy responses to addiction need to find a balance between restricting the liberty of those who cause harm to others as a consequence of drug use and taking measures, such as treatment, which aim to maximise an addict's autonomy
This issue is discussed in greater detail in the next section
Do opioiddependent individuals possess autonomy? The 'chronic and relapsing brain disease model' of addiction has prompted some ethicists to question the capacity of opioiddependent individuals to consent to some forms of treatment for their dependence (Charland, 2002; Cohen, 2002; Elliott, 2002; Roberts, 2002; Caplan, 2006)
It is argued that heroin addicts are unable to make rational decisions about whether to accept an offer of heroin either in the setting of a research study (Cohen, 2002), or in a clinical trial of heroin maintenance treatment (Charland, 2002)
Charland argues that heroin addicts are incapable of saying 'no' to heroin: 'their decision is not truly theirs' (Charland, 2002, p
43)
Based on their reading of the neuroscience literature, these ethicists argue that heroin addicts are 'neurochemically driven' to take heroin; they are 'hijacked' by the drug
These arguments, if accepted and directly applied, would raise ethical objections to addicts participating in research or clinical trials that involved consumption of their drug of addiction (e.g
trials of injectable heroin), or its agonists (e.g
methadone)
It would raise similar doubts about the capacity of opioid addicts to freely consent to substitution treatments (e.g
MMT) (Carter and Hall, 2008)
The arguments of Charland and Cohen interpret the DSMIV criteria that describe 'loss of control' and 'compulsive' behaviour in absolute terms
However, the DSMIV criteria that they rely on do not constitute evidence
Charland's argument is based on the testimony of a single reformed heroin addict who claimed that heroin users are unable to say 'no' to an offer of heroin
In fact, overwhelmingly this view is not supported by empirical evidence, as illustrated by: • Swiss heroin trials (a clinical trial of prescribed injectable heroin to severe heroin addicts) were not inundated with untreated heroin addicts seeking 'free heroin'
This was clearest in a randomised controlled trial of immediate versus delayed entry to heroin maintenance (with the delayed entry group given access to usual treatment, methadone maintenance or abstinence) (Perneger et al., 1998)
The researchers 77 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications intended to recruit 40 patients in each group but only recruited 24 and 27 patients, respectively
Moreover, when those who were allocated to delayed entry to heroin treatment were offered the choice at the end of six months, two thirds of the group decided against receiving heroin (Perneger et al., 1998)
Severely dependent treatment refractory Swiss heroin addicts were thus capable of saying 'no' to an offer of prescribed heroin
• Many addicts are able to control their drug use in certain circumstances, without assistance and for varying periods in order to reduce their tolerance; to take time out from the rigours of their lifestyle; or respond to changes in life situation (e.g
birth of a child, input from friends, family and employers)
• Returning Vietnam veterans were able to quit opioid use without treatment once back in the U.S
(Gerstein and Harwood, 1990)
In order for 'addiction' to plausibly deny the autonomy of opioiddependent individuals, this internal 'neurochemical drive' must be irresistible and absolute
The neuroscience evidence that Charland and Cohen rely on is not as clear as they suggest: • evidence for 'compulsive' drug use emerged from highly controlled laboratory animal studies that arguably have a limited application to human compulsive behaviour or the contexts in which humans typically use drugs
• human neuroimaging and neurocognitive research shows that addicts as a group show changes in brain function that are associated with a reduced ability to control drug use and they perform more poorly in neurocognitive tests of decisionmaking than nonaddicts
These studies demonstrate a tendency for addiction to diminish neurocognitive capacity and function in some but not all addicts
Significantly, not all those who are addicted display these cognitive deficits while some nonaddicted people do (Bechara et al., 2001; Bechara, 2005)
In summary, neuroscience research on addiction does not prove that addicts lack autonomy: while their autonomy is clearly impaired in some situations, particularly during withdrawal or intoxication, addicts retain some degree of control over their drug use and hence, some degree of autonomy
The aim of treatment should be to increase patient decisionmaking capacity and autonomy (Spriggs, 2005) rather than prevent addicts from participating in research and treatment that may be of benefit to them
Informed consent and addiction Consent refers to the capacity of agents to act according to their will, or to understand the consequences of an outcome, usually in relation to a decision to agree to enter treatment or participate in research
The question as to whether an addict possesses autonomy is central to whether they have the capacity to give consent
To give consent is to exercise one's autonomy
78 Chapter 4: Human rights, ethical values and the implications of current addiction research When drugdependent individuals seek treatment, they are often in a desperate state psychologically, socially, financially and physically
Addicts may also be neurocognitively impaired when they are intoxicated or in withdrawal
Given that many people who are addicted do not wish to be treated, they are often under some degree of social duress or external coercion to enter treatment
There can also be conflict between the interests of the person seeking treatment and the community who regularly funds the treatment programmes and decides how they are run
This can influence what people are required to consent to when they enter treatment and how their consent is obtained
Informed consent is the formal process by which individuals agree to enter treatment in the full knowledge of its possible risks and benefits and in the absence of duress or coercion (Faden et al., 1986; Roberts, 2002; Walker et al., 2005)
Individuals must be fully informed about the options open to them in order to be able to make autonomous decisions and therefore express their human rights
The process of informed consent is generally understood to require that an individual: 1) has the capacity to understand treatment and communicate their wishes; 2) is fully informed of the risks and benefits of treatment, as well as those of other treatment options; 3) is free of internal or external coercion in making their decision (Faden et al., 1986; Roberts, 2002; Walker et al., 2005); and 4) has equal access to all effective forms of treatment that are appropriately provided (Carter and Hall, 2008) ( 2 )
The minimum requirements for obtaining informed consent to the treatment of addiction are provided in the box on p
80
Surprisingly, there has been very little research into: how informed consent is obtained in the treatment of addiction; participants' perspectives on the consent process; the impact that particular consent procedures have on treatment outcomes; or how these procedures might be improved (Sugarman et al., 1999; Walker et al., 2005)
There has been some limited research on the capacity of individuals with an addiction to give internally uncoerced consent and to understand the consequences of agreeing to research (Harrison et al., 1995; Fureman et al., 1997)
More research is urgently required
Promising research that attempts to develop neurocognitive tools that may help both researchers and clinicians to assess an individual's ability to provide free and informed consent is under way (Hazelton et al., 2003; Cairns et al., 2005; Hotopf, 2005; Smith et al., 2006)
( 2 ) This last provision, which is not included in traditional formulations of consent, is particularly relevant in the provision of drug dependence treatment where there are competing social and political forces that determine what treatment options are available, and the manner in which these treatments are provided
79 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Minimum requirements for ethical consent to addiction treatment Addicts can differ markedly both in the severity and length of their addiction, as well as in their social, financial and psychological circumstances (Roberts, 2002)
They will also differ in their willingness to overcome their addiction (Walker et al., 2005)
An informed consent process that is too narrow and rigid, epitomised by signing a medicolegal consent form, can therefore gloss over the complex nature of consenting to enter addiction treatment, making it difficult to ascertain whether consent is free and informed
This is especially true when an individual's capacity to consent may change dramatically over time
Adopting too narrow a view of the consent process may also lead to poorer treatment outcomes
The autonomy of addicts in making choices about their drug use is undoubtedly impaired when they are acutely intoxicated or experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms
A strong argument therefore exists that addicts who enter treatment while intoxicated or in withdrawal should not be asked to sign detailed treatment contracts on admission to treatment
The worst of drug withdrawal symptoms should be reduced by medication (or have abated as a result of completing withdrawal)
Patients should also be given time to consider their treatment options before they are required to make longterm or farreaching decisions that are often implied by signing a treatment contract
Once patients have stabilised, they should be provided with enough information to make a decision that is in their own interests
Given that there are a number of external social factors which influence what and how treatment is offered, the type of information provided during consent is likely to be critical, both to the outcome for the individual, and to ensure that the process of consent conforms with appropriate ethical requirements
From an ethical perspective, it is important that the treatment chosen reflects the aims of the individual rather than those of the staff or the wider community
The issues around the justification for compulsory treatment are addressed later in this report
To allow the patient to make an informed choice about what sort of treatment they are entering, information is required about (Carter and Hall, 2008): • the treatment programme (e.g
its aims, risks and benefits, and costs); • programme rules and regulations (e.g
information on drug testing regimes, responses to positive urine samples, the intended length of treatment, costs, where and how often drugs are to be dispensed and the involvement of the criminal justice system and rights to privacy and confidentiality); • the effectiveness of the programme and the likelihood of competing alternative treatment options; • their freedom to refuse treatment or seek treatment elsewhere
80 Chapter 4: Human rights, ethical values and the implications of current addiction research Liberty and addiction Liberty is the condition in which an individual has the ability to act according to his or her own will within a coercive — but stabilising — framework of law
Liberty is premised on the notion that each individual can have a different conception about what is good for them, and therefore they should have the freedom of choice
Their choices are, however, restrained by the state which upholds individual rights and equality of opportunity
Such coercion is justified, or so it is maintained, because different conceptions of the good will inevitably come into conflict, and therefore social stability calls for rules to govern each others' private lives in the public sphere (Capps, 2007)
Liberties can thereby be justly removed on the grounds that they are not human rights (Kramer, 2002, pp
1020)
Liberty therefore refers to the freedom to engage in some activity without hindrance from others, so long as the expression of one's liberty is not to the detriment of others' human rights
A commitment to liberty demands that individuals accept certain sacrifices — especially to exercise selfrestraint — in their daytoday lives
This means that each individual is responsible for their actions, and they are expected to observe rules pertaining to their actions
Liberty calls for a legal system which enforces rules according to the public interest, which in turn reflects on, and provides for, a stable existence for all citizens
Thus, in systems of rights, individual 'choices' are often qualified by the public interest, which include the justification of interference
This relationship is expressed in various human rights instruments
For example, the UK's Human Rights Act 1998 states that rights may be justifiably suspended: 'in accordance with the law and as is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others' (Article 8, Right to respect for private and family life; similar statements accompany the other Articles of the Act)
When one breaks legally enforceable rules, they should expect that they will be dealt with fairly before the law, through a system of adjudication that may deprive them of some of their liberties
Thus, human rights frameworks recognise the value to individuals of their personal liberty and their ability to exercise their autonomy, and hence they recognise the need for an appropriate justification for any interference in the enjoyment of these
Equality and addiction Equality expresses a social benchmark which prescribes that in pluralistic cultures, where there are competing conceptions, each individual will be treated equally in morally relevant ways
This will extend to treatment under the law
Given that there are no established criteria of what moral aspects count as relevant, proactive measures normally 81 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications aim to reduce inequality
This has significant implications for the operation of the law (e.g
a right to a fair trial, and rights against some degrading or tortuous punishments) and for individual autonomy (such as equality of resources, welfare and freedom)
This amounts to a requirement that policies not discriminate between individuals on the grounds of sex, race or social status, and contribute to and affirm social and economic equality
This latter condition is particularly relevant to how individuals are given fair access to medical interventions
Questions of distributive justice are important, and are subject to detailed analysis below
With regard to addiction, the moral and medical models have very different implications for how addicted individuals and drug users are dealt with by the law
On the one hand, the 'moral' or 'sceptical' model is likely to place an emphasis on the criminal aspects of drug use, and thereby consider addicts and illicit drug users to have forfeited claims to equality and opportunity during the course of social 'punishment'
Importantly, such a position may have more to do with an idea of equity, in the narrow sense of the term, which has its basis in the principle 'to give each his due'
Such measures may not take account of prior failings in equality and opportunity, or the role of luck in maintaining a 'moral life'
On the other hand, the medical model takes account of the observations that addicted individuals, by virtue of their condition, require 'additional' state assistance — such as medical care, social support to enable employability, and guidance in their responsibilities — above what a nonaddicted person might receive
Equality, in this case, may lead to measures which attempt to raise the status of addicts to a more equitable level
Privacy and addiction Privacy is perhaps best understood as a bundle of rights that an individual or group have to keep their lives and personal affairs out of public view, or to control the flow of information about themselves (e.g
protect confidentiality)
Protection of privacy is not an absolute moral principle, and therefore, a balance has to be found between privacy and other ethical considerations (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2007, p
28)
Thus, strengthening privacy rules should not indicate that drug users' privacy or confidentiality should not be overridden by justified legal measures
As already stated, privacy stems from rights which entail certain duties, and therefore responsibility in living one's life includes obligations to the community — not a right to do as one wants
With a better understanding of neurobiology comes a greater capacity and power to pry into the innermost secrets of the brain, mind and selfhood
For some, this is an alarming development, that has been described as the use of pharmacotherapy to expand the '..
drug war battlefield ..
to a new terrain directly inside the bodies and brains of drug users' (Centre for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics, 2004, p
6)
Some commentators have even argued that the ability to directly monitor brain activity is a 82 Chapter 4: Human rights, ethical values and the implications of current addiction research 'threat to cognitive liberty' (Centre for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics, 2004, p
4)
Similar claims have been made about genetic screening
These bold claims need to be justified by an objective evaluation of what technologies such as neuroimaging are actually able to find reliably
The ethical implications of being able to monitor brain activity through functional neuroimaging is discussed in greater detail later in this report (see 'Neuroscience, prediction and privacy', p
117)
83 Chapter 5 New developments in the treatment of addiction Adrian Carter, Wayne Hall, Benjamin Capps and Ruud ter Meulen Introduction Neuroscience research of addiction holds the promise of providing a number of novel treatment technologies that may significantly reduce the impact and prevalence of addiction and drug abuse
However, along with the considerable potential for good comes a potential for significant harm
As with any new technology, the impact that these novel developments have upon the individual being treated, and the rest of European society, will depend on how they are used
As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, addiction is a complex neurobiological, mental and social disorder
The use of new technologies is complicated, not simply by the complexity of the disorder, but by the tension between a goal of treating a neuropsychiatric condition and the goal of protecting society from the harmful behaviour of drug users
This balance is further complicated by the social and moral attitudes held by many towards those who are addicted to drugs
It is accordingly important to carefully consider the ethical motivation for intervention and the social context in which these technologies are used
Establishing a human rights framework requires balancing individual and public interests
In the previous chapter, it was suggested that this could be achieved by committing to ethical values which strike a balance between these two competing interests
In the context of this report, the ethical values of autonomy (empowering individuals to make worthwhile choices about their lives), liberty (the freedom to act according to one's choices but within the constraints of a fair sociolegal system), privacy (the power to protect the flow of information about oneself), and consent (the power to modify interagent relationships), are central to the ethical use of new technologies arising from neurobiological research on addiction
Of central importance to this task is a consideration of how neuroscience research on addiction influences our understanding of addiction and in particular, our understanding of the autonomous decisionmaking capacity of the addicted individual
This has important implications for how society attempts to engage or encourage addicted individuals into treatment, particularly those who may not want to be treated
A review of the literature on the neuroscience of addiction reveals that chronic drug use does impact upon the neurocognitive systems involved in making decisions and controlling behaviour
However, this impact does not prevent absolutely the ability for addicted 85 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications individuals to choose not to use drugs
While neuroscience does provide a strong justification for the need for medical treatment and intervention, it does not suggest that this intervention should override the autonomous decisionmaking capacity of the individual, based solely on their being addicted
Individuals with an addiction should be treated in the same manner as other members of society within the dictates of law and fundamental rights and with respect to access to appropriate medical and social supports
The choice of treatment available to the addicted should be dictated by a need to treat their condition and not as a form of extrajudicial punishment
This is particularly relevant to policy decisions regarding the use of substitution or replacement therapies where their use may be limited, or provided in ways that are not motivated by the desire to treat
A corollary of this argument is that treatments should be provided in a way that does not further harm society
Treatments often involve the use of drugs which can cause harm to society if misused
This section uses the ethical framework developed in Chapter 4 to analyse how the neuroscience research and technologies outlined in Chapters 2 and 3 could be used in a way that allows for the greatest benefit, while protecting society and individuals from unanticipated consequences or misuses
This section provides a detailed analysis of the competing issues that impact on how technologies are used
The analysis has led to the following observations on the use of emerging technologies for the treatment of addiction in a number of circumstances, which are summarised below: Coerced treatment 1
The use of some form of coercion or persuasion is a legitimate part of ethical treatment of addiction, and necessary in order for a state to fulfil its human rights obligations of offering the highest possible attainable standard of healthcare, ensuring equity, and enabling addicted individuals to express the full state of their autonomy and liberty
It is also important in recognising that some crimes committed by some addicted individuals arise from their addiction
2
However, any use of legal coercion should not override whatever autonomous decisionmaking capacity addicts have
It should also be motivated by a desire to treat the individual, and not used as a form of costcutting (treatment being generally cheaper than imprisonment) or as a form of extrajudicial punishment
3
Consequently, individuals who are legally coerced into treatment should be offered a dualconstrained choice: first, a choice of whether to enter treatment or not, with refusal leaving them to face criminal proceedings for their crime like any other individual charged with the same offence; and secondly, a choice of treatment from a range of effective options that are available to the wider community, which could include for those addicted to opioid drugs substitution or maintenance therapy
86 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction 4
While new prophylactic technologies which aim to block drug use are an important treatment option, they should only constitute one type of treatment among a choice of many
In making a choice about treatment, addicted persons should be given accurate information about the advantages and disadvantages of each, including their likelihood of success
Medicalisation of addiction 1
Neuroscience research has made significant advances in our understanding of the nature of addiction, and the cognitive and behavioural changes that underpin it
This will potentially lead to more effective treatments, and more appropriate social policies, although it should be noted that success has been limited to date
2
Enthusiasm generated by developments in this area needs to be tempered by an acknowledgement of the role that social and psychological factors play in initiation of drug use, the development and expression of addictive behaviours, the way that society responds to addiction, and the proven effectiveness of some existing responses
3
Addiction neuroscience may help us to understand the biological and cognitive aspects of addiction, but does not reduce the importance of the social and psychological in the way in which society responds to it
Acknowledging this is important in preventing neuroscience research from being used to promote unproven or dubious 'cures' for addiction (e.g
neurosurgery, ultrarapid opioid detoxification) which may be marketed to vulnerable and desperate addicts, and where evidence of their safety or efficacy may be limited or absent
Pharmacological relapse prevention 1
Relapse to drug use is the norm in persons treated for addiction
Pharmacological treatments that help to reduce relapse, such as naltrexone implants, may prove to be an important innovation but they need to be properly evaluated in controlled clinical trials before being used clinically
2
Clients need also to be made aware of any potential side effects (e.g
detection, dysphoria), the likelihood of success, and in the case of opiate addiction, the potential for overdose should they cease treatment and revert to heroin use, or try to override the implant
3
The offer of these implants under legal coercion should include the choice of other treatment options
Preventive vaccination 1
Vaccines which provide an immunological block against drug activity are another novel development which may prove to provide prophylaxis against relapse
87 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications 2
More speculatively, vaccines may protect those who are identified as vulnerable to addiction (e.g
genetic or psychological screening), particularly during adolescence when many forms of addiction begin
3
Preventive use of genetics and vaccines is limited to the predictive power of the screening technology
Widescale genetic screening for the entire population is not feasible on the basis of present data
4
Some parents may wish to vaccinate their children, particularly if there is a family history of drug addiction but enthusiasm for these preventive technologies must be tempered by an acknowledgement of the limited protection that these vaccines may provide
Unlike normal vaccines, they are likely to be shortlived, requiring boosters, and can be overridden by using larger doses of the addictive drug or by using another drug
Preventive vaccination could also prove to be counterproductive and the cost versus benefits of any developments in this area require considerable scrutiny
Drug testing 1
Drug testing can be an important part of managing an effective treatment, or monitoring the effectiveness of a particular treatment programme
But drug testing is only as good as the responses to the test results
A strong argument can be made that drug tests should be used to provide better treatment, and not used as a form of extrajudicial punishment, within the constraints of protecting society from further harm
2
All information gathered as a result of drug testing should remain private, and treated with the same regard for confidentiality as other medical records
Neuroscience and privacy 1
Neuroimaging has enabled researchers to gain insight into the neurobiological contributions to behaviour, cognition and personality
It is important that the claims made reflect what neuroimaging is able to show
Reports should acknowledge the important technological limitations and experimental caveats associated with this technology
Often neuroimages only show trends of difference between groups of people
2
All neuroimaging results should remain private as for all other medical information
Psychopharmacological harm reduction 1
Neuroscience holds out the possibility of developing safer forms of currently addictive drugs
Should this happen, a number of controversial and difficult issues are likely to arise for policy making and regulation
It will be necessary to consider any new drug on its merits, based on a cost/benefit analysis of the harms that any new substance is likely to cause, or alleviate
88 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction Personal health and the public interest in addiction treatment Addiction affects an agent's autonomy and ability to consent
The treatment of drug dependence is complicated by two additional issues
First, many of those addicted who seek treatment are involved in the criminal justice system because they have been arrested for offences committed to fund their drug use
As a result, they may be coerced into treatment (thus directly losing their autonomy and liberty through the actions of a third party) to reduce the adverse effects that their behaviour has on society
Second, many drugdependent persons are not able to pay the costs of their treatment
In many developed countries, this usually means that drug treatment is provided either by charitable nongovernment organisations (NGOs) or by governments, with a small private sector catering to wealthy addicts
This is particularly true of opioid addiction (')
The NGO sector has traditionally provided drugfree forms of treatment such as residential rehabilitation programmes, selfhelp groups and outpatient counselling
Government programmes have more often provided pharmacologicallybased treatments such as agonist maintenance treatment
These programmes have often been funded because they provide a costeffective form of treatment, with the largest cost savings arising from the fact that these programmes have been shown to substantially reduce crime among opioid dependent persons
Importantly, these treatment programmes have also been shown to be effective in reducing the physical and social harms associated with drug abuse, such as overdose, crime and violence
These treatment programmes can therefore be referred to as 'harm reduction' programmes (Ward et al., 1998; Hall et al., 2006) (see pp
9495)
The fact that pharmacological treatment of addiction serves mixed personal, public health and public order goals complicates its provision
As noted above, it often involves interactions between the health and criminal justice systems, in which conflicts can arise between different professions and their distinctive priorities (e.g
law enforcement, clinical staff, and public health)
The same can be true for conflicts between public health and personal medical care professionals who observe different aims, methods of acting, and guides according to their professions
The use of pharmacological treatments means that maintenance treatment falls under the umbrella of medicine as these drugs are prescribed by physicians
Yet, as noted, the justification for public funding of maintenance treatment for drug dependence often depends at least in part upon the public health and public order benefits (via reduced criminal activity) that they produce (Hall et al., 2006)
Clinical medicine 'focuses on the treatment and cure of individual patients', while public health medicine 'aims to understand and ameliorate the causes of disease and disability (') The following analysis is based largely on the experience of opioiddependence treatment
This is because there has been considerable effort in the last century to develop treatment programmes for opioid addiction and because opioids are the only drugs for which a variety of different pharmacological treatments are available (e.g
agonist, antagonist, partial agonist)
89 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications in a population' (Childress et al., 2002, p
170)
While 'the physicianpatient relationship is at the centre of medicine', public health involves 'interactions and relationships among many professionals and members of the community as well as agencies of government' (Childress et al., 2002, p
170)
The latter involves many government institutions, and a likely consequence of their involvement in drug policies is use of the criminal justice system to coerce patients into treatment, amplifying opportunities for conflict between the competing goals of addiction treatment
The tensions between these competing goals calls for management structures which can appropriately balance the medical needs of addicted individuals, their rights and the public interest (the public health and criminal justice responses)
Public ambivalence about maintaining addicts on agonist drugs and a desire to limit any potential negative impact on the wider community of substitution treatment often results in the development of standards, rules and regulations for this form of treatment that: • are intended to minimise the risk of nonaddicted persons entering treatment (e.g
by demanding evidence of an extensive history of dependence and documented failure at abstinence treatment); • aim to prevent the diversion of addictive drugs intended for substitution treatment to the black market where they may be used inappropriately and result in physical or psychological harm, overdose deaths or further addiction; • result in programmes which specify the frequency of urine testing and may require patients to be excluded from programmes if they provide 'dirty' urine samples; • or that may place time limits on treatment or insist upon a goal of abstinence from all drugs being achieved within some arbitrary period (e.g
one or two years)
These regulatory frameworks may have unintended medical effects that may have a negative impact on the health of some addicts
For example, these types of regulations may: discourage dependent persons from seeking treatment until their condition is chronic, reduce programme retention because of the onerous requirements made of patients, or force stable patients to withdraw from treatment and return to illicit drug use (Ward et al., 1992)
Ethically acceptable and effective agonist maintenance treatment of dependence requires programme rules and regulations that balance patient and community safety while permitting patients to remain in and benefit from treatment
The goal should be to provide effective treatment which is based on a multifaceted strategy that addresses all of the needs of the individual
It is important that treatment choices made by those seeking help are not limited by the ideological viewpoints of the staff that operate individual treatment programmes, even if some treatment services work within a particular model of care
Individuals who receive support and counselling must have 90 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction access to appropriate pharmacological drugs if required, while those in maintenance and relapse prevention programmes should not be limited to just pharmacological strategies
Treatment services should also recognise that the circumstances and needs of their patients may change as their treatment progresses, and this will require a flexible response
Distributive justice: balancing the burden of disease and treatment The justification of the public funding for addiction treatment programmes in terms of the public benefits is important in obtaining support
However, there is a danger that public policies that are beneficial to the majority may impose unfair burdens on a vulnerable minority
An important aspect of ethical analysis of drug dependence treatment is ensuring that public policies do not unfairly burden or discriminate against a vulnerable minority in order to serve the public good ( 2 )
Distributive justice is a difficult and emotively charged issue in the case of addiction because drug use and drug policy have negative impacts on both society and the dependent individual
This raises important questions about the distribution of responsibility between society and the addicted individual
For treatment to be ethical, it should demonstrate that it is effective in reducing negative outcomes for both society and the individual
However, it would be arguably unethical to use pharmacological treatment of dependence as a form of compensation for inappropriate social policies or the neglect of vulnerable populations, no matter how effective the treatment was in improving the status quo
Those who receive treatment, particularly when it is publicly funded and subsidised, also arguably have a responsibility to engage in a reasonable treatment programme, to meet its aims and to avoid behaviour that adversely affects society
The remainder of this section is focused on analysing: (1) the impact that society and social policy has on drug use, the responsibility of society to reduce this impact and the ethics of providing pharmacological treatment to a vulnerable population, and (2) the responsibility of addicts to engage and comply with treatment, and what measures society may reasonably take to ensure compliance with this obligation
The ethics of pharmacological treatment of vulnerable populations Few public issues have produced a global consensus in the way that prohibition of the recreational use of illicit drugs has, particularly for what are regarded as the 'harder' drugs such as heroin and cocaine
While there is disagreement around the margins, such as exactly which drugs should be illegal, and how to treat those that use and become ( 2 ) Such a public policy would be justified on a purely utilitarian analysis as already outlined, however this report takes the more generally held perspective that that there are other important ethical principles that need to be respected and balanced against the greater good
91 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications dependent on illicit drugs, most nation states have enacted laws that prohibit or restrict their use
These restrictive policies are designed to protect the majority of society who do not use illicit drugs for recreational purposes and discourage their recreational use
These policies are effective in reducing rates of recreational illicit drug use but arguably they also can result in aggravating or causing problems for the small minority of those who continue to use illicit drugs
Discussion on the fairness of pharmacological treatment of drug dependence therefore needs to consider the impact that the illegality of these drugs has on those who use them
An analysis of the arguments for and against the prohibition of illicit drugs is beyond the scope and not the intention of this report
While acknowledging the debate in this area which raises important and interesting ethical and policy issues, the remainder of the report accepts the current legal status of illicit drugs in the majority of EU Member States
This acknowledges the reality that the global policy of prohibiting recreational illicit drug use is not likely to change and it ensures that our arguments have the potential to affect the ethical provision of treatment for drug dependence under current legal regimes
Policies that govern the treatment of dependence need to acknowledge the social, biological and psychological factors that can lead to addiction
While it is important that drug treatment programmes are available, it is also important to ensure that pharmacological treatment does not become a surrogate for social policies that neglect certain populations
This is particularly pertinent given the strong association between social disadvantage, family history of violence and drug use and the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders, and emerging evidence of genetic and neuropsychological vulnerabilities to addiction (Hall et ah, 2006)
While social differentials in addiction risk do not free from blame those who use drugs, they do create an onus on social policymakers to be mindful of these social differentials and to work to reduce them, in the interests of ethical drug policy, and in order to reduce addiction
Social policies that are based on solidarity and social responsibility should provide more humane and less punitive treatment for those who become dependent and use interventions that aim to reduce the social disadvantage and adversity that increases the likelihood of addiction
This may include ensuring equal opportunities exist for those disadvantaged through public investments in education, family education and support, and social welfare (Spooner and Hall, 2002)
Reciprocal obligations for individuals receiving treatment As argued above, a solidaritybased approach puts emphasis not only on the responsibility of society, but also on the responsibility of the addicted individuals
Those with an addiction still have some capacity to make choices, as was discussed earlier
They therefore arguably have some obligations to comply with the reasonable demands of treatment
Society is justified in expecting that drugdependent individuals who engage in treatment adhere to treatment demands and do not act in ways that 92 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction adversely affect society
For example, while methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been shown to be relatively safe and effective in reducing opioid use, it can lead to overdose if methadone is diverted to opioidnai've users
In the UK during the 1990s, poorly regulated methadone programmes lead to the diversion of methadone onto the black market resulting in fatal methadone overdoses involving persons not in treatment (Hall, 1998)
The same may occur with the new pharmacological agents that are likely to be used to treat addiction to stimulants and other illicit drugs
This risk highlights the importance of delivering treatments in ways that protect the person receiving them and the broader society
It indicates the need for regulations, procedures and treatment requirements in the provision of treatment that protect both patients and the wider community
A broad set of ethical principles are relevant to treatment regulations that impose obligations on those who enter treatment
These include: (1) not unduly violating the privacy and autonomy of individuals; (2) ensuring that the responses made to individual lapses in meeting objectives are proportional in relation to the overall treatment goals sought; (3) being mindful and consistent with the ability of individuals to meet their obligations (including actively helping individuals to do so); and (4) being sensitive to the situation of the individual, with regard to both internal (neurophysiology and neuropsychology) and external (social) circumstances
Coerced treatment of drug abuse and addiction There is reasonable evidence that those who enter pharmacological treatment for drug abuse will benefit from the treatment and the longer they remain in treatment, the better off they will be (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990; Ward et al., 1998)
The fact that many drugdependent persons do not wish to enter treatment has led to the use of various forms of coercion to encourage them to enter and remain in treatment
This raises the questions: to what extent can legal coercion be used ethically and effectively in the treatment of drug addiction and if so, under what conditions is it ethical to do so? There are different forms of coerced treatment for drug addiction that vary in the amount of force used, and therefore in the degree to which they contravene an individual's liberty, freedom and autonomy
Mild informal coercion includes social pressure from friends and family to enter treatment (Maddux, 1988)
More formal coercion (not involving criminal proceedings) may come from employers and government agencies who make it a condition of continued employment that an addicted person undergoes treatment (Weisner, 1990)
Legally enforced forms of coercion involve the use of the criminal justice system to enforce entry to treatment on pain of imprisonment (Klag et al., 2005)
Social coercion is an effective motivation for addicts to enter and complete treatment (Room et al., 1991; Hasin, 1994; Wild et al., 1998)
Addiction puts an enormous emotional and financial burden on families so it is not surprising that pressure from loved ones (e.g
highlighting the destructive impact of a person's drug use or threatening to end a 93 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications relationship if they continue to use drugs), can motivate those who still have strong social ties to seek treatment
Many addicts do not appreciate the impact that their drug use has on themselves or their friends and families; pressure from friends and family to cease their drug use often provides an external indication that their drug use is problematic
Unfortunately, for some longterm drug abusers, such important social ties have lost either influence or significance in their lives so more coercive forms of intervention may be required
When this is the case, they require formal noncriminal coercion and negotiation between agencies or employers and the individual and the ethical guidelines for how these programmes should operate need to be codified in the appropriate laws (e.g
industrial relations)
While informal social coercion and formal noncriminal coercion represent very important motives for entering treatment, they arguably raise fewer ethical issues in the treatment of dependence than legally coerced treatment
In both these cases, the dependent person is relatively free to agree to treatment or suffer the threatened consequence (such as loss of employment or relationship)
The coercive pressure in these situations arguably does not deprive them of their liberty or deny their autonomy
The form of coercion that raises more ethical concerns is court sanctioned coercion in which the threat of imprisonment is used to motivate entry into, or compliance with, addiction treatment
The case for legally coerced treatment One of the major justifications for the use of legally coerced treatment is that treating offenders' drug dependence will reduce the likelihood of their reoffending (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990; Inciardi and McBride, 1991)
Stud ies have shown quite convincingly that treatment for heroin dependence significantly reduces criminal and violent behaviour while addicts remain in treatment (Hubbard, 1989; Gerstein and Harwood, 1990; Bell et al., 1992; Ward et al., 1992)
The use of drug treatment programmes as an alternative to incarceration has also been motivated by the failure of prison terms to reduce drug use and drugrelated crime and the overrepresentation of drug dependent people in prisons (Pedic, 1990; Stathis, 1991; Stathis et al., 1991; Hall, 1997)
Medical models of addiction highlight the causal role that addiction plays in leading to imprisonment and the high rates of relapse to use after release (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990)
The advent of HIV/AIDS has provided an additional argument for treating drug abuse (Dolan et al., 1996)
By keeping injecting users out of prison, there is likely to be a reduction in the transmission of infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
Those injecting drugs in prison may be at a significantly increased risk of contracting bloodborne viruses because of a lack of access to sterile injecting equipment in most prisons (Dolan et al., 1996; Small et al., 2005; 94 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction Wood et al., 2005)
The incidence of HIV and HCV is also generally significantly higher in prison populations than the wider public (Dolan, 1999; Dolan et al., 2006)
The ethical, correctional and public health arguments for drug treatment under coercion are reinforced by the economic argument that it is less costly to treat offenders who are drug dependent in the community than it is to imprison them (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990)
Legal coercion covers a wide range of strategies for getting individuals into treatment programmes
The most coercive is compulsory treatment programmes, such as civil commitment programmes in the US and Sweden where individuals are sentenced by the court to enforced addiction treatment in a secure facility for an extended period of time (Weisner, 1990; Farabee and Leukefeld, 2001)
While such treatment strategies were used frequently in the past in the US, these civil commitment programmes now appear to have fallen out of favour arguably in part because of the difficulty in ethically justifying such deprivation of liberty, and because of evidence suggesting that newer legal options for coerced treatment are more effective (Wild, 1999) (')
The form of legal coercion that has become increasingly popular within the criminal justice system is the use of diversionary programmes that offer drug dependent persons treatment as an alternative to imprisonment at various stages in the criminal justice process
In the first instance, treatment may be offered as an alternative to being prosecuted with an offence prior to being charged by police
This is not an ideal method of coercion as it falls outside judicial oversight
It is possible that relying on the discretion of the police may open the way for individuals being coerced into treatment for reasons other than criminal behaviour, such as odd or unconventional behaviour or being a member of an ethnic minority (Hall, 1997)
Legally coerced treatment is most often advocated for persons charged with or convicted of an offence to which their drug dependence has contributed
It is generally offered as an alternative to imprisonment in order to have legal sanctions deferred, reduced or lifted, or as a condition of parole (Rotgers, 1992; Klag et al., 2005)
Suspension of legal sanctions is usually made conditional upon successful completion of a treatment programme, with the threat of imprisonment if the person fails to comply (Hall, 1997; Spooner et al., 2001)
Each of these forms of legally coerced treatment have different legal and social consequences for the offenders subjected to them, requiring varying degrees of deprivation of liberty, restraint and hardship
The ethical validity of the use of these forms of coercion will be outlined below
(') While civil commitment statutes were created throughout the 1960s in the US, no state is currently committing significant numbers for drug treatment (Gostin, 1993)
95 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications When is coerced treatment ethical? Careful consideration of ethical issues is critical when the state uses the threat of imprisonment to encourage drugdependent persons to seek treatment
Coerced treatment of addiction should operate within a constitutional and legal framework which protects the civil liberties of the people being coerced (Klag et al., 2005)
It is important that treatment does not override an individual's basic human rights in order to achieve broader social goals (Anderer, 1992; Bersoff, 1992; Wexler, 1993; Kleinig, 2004)
Coerced treatment for addiction may be justified by appealing to either of two ethical principles: paternalism or the public interest
Addiction is a harmful behaviour in which to engage; it impacts negatively on an individual's health and social welfare, with a significantly increased mortality and morbidity
Coerced treatment of addiction could therefore be justified for paternalistic reasons: that is, on the grounds that it is in the best interests of the individual
This would involve coerced treatment for the addict's 'own good'
Two forms of paternalism can be distinguished on the basis of the degree of coercion involved
Treatment that is provided against an individual's wishes, where the individual is deemed competent to make this decision is referred to as hard paternalism
When an individual is deemed incapable of making a competent decision, treatment is imposed because it is argued that their condition prevents them from making informed decisions on their own behalf
This form of coerced treatment is referred to as soft paternalism
It is soft paternalism that is most likely to be used to justify coerced treatment in the case of addiction
In many countries, people with serious mental illnesses can be compelled to accept treatment under certain circumstances, usually after some form of judicial or quasi judicial review
Society does not, however, generally treat people suffering from other medical conditions against their will, unless the individual lacks the capacity to give free and informed consent to treatment, as in minimally conscious patients
While there is a strong beneficent justification for providing treatment, respect for an individual's liberty to make their own decisions about treatment generally overrides the beneficent drive to intervene (Dworkin, 1972; Childress et al., 2002)
This would prevent the use of coerced treatment using a hard paternalistic justification
The use of paternalistically coerced treatment could be justified if addicted individuals were seen to suffer from a brain disease that robbed them of their autonomy and impaired their capacity to consent to treatment, as has been argued by some bioethicists (Charland, 2002; Cohen, 2002; Elliott, 2002; Dackis and O'Brien, 2005)
This justification would be similar to the forced treatment of minimally conscious patients or children, or mentally ill adults where consent to treat is obtained from a surrogate, usually the next of kin
However, as argued above, this soft paternalist rationale for coerced addiction treatment would be based on a misrepresentation of the neurobiology of addiction
While addicts' decisionmaking is impaired, they retain some degree of 96 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction control over their drug use which undermines the soft paternalistic justification of coerced treatment
The second principle that can be used to justify coerced treatment of drug abuse and addiction is to protect the social welfare or the public good
The public good claim for the use of coerced treatment depends upon the negative impact of drug dependent users on society (e.g
via drug dealing and other criminal activity to finance their drug use)
The ethical justification of coerced treatment in order to protect the public good therefore becomes a distributive justice issue: that is, providing a fair distribution of the costs and benefits of drug use and drug treatment
This analysis arguably creates an obligation on society to provide treatment, and an analogous obligation on drug abusers to accept treatment under certain circumstances
This has been the most commonly used justification for coerced treatment of addiction (Hall 1997)
The question is: when or under what circumstances is coerced treatment justified in order to protect the public good? Some authors reject any form of treatment under coercion for drug dependence
Radical libertarians such as Thomas Szasz and Theodore Dalrymple deny that drug dependence exists, arguing that all drug use is always voluntary (Szasz, 1975; Dalrymple, 2006)
According to Szasz, the law should not prohibit adults from using any drug, and any drug user who commits a criminal offence should be punished
The punitive policy consequences of Szasz's libertarianism often enjoys more public support in developed countries than the proposal to legalise the use of all currently illegal drugs
Others, such as Newman, accept that drug dependence exists but oppose compulsory drug treatment on the grounds that it does not work (Newman, 1974)
If treatment under coercion were ineffective (as Newman claims), then there would be no ethical justification for providing it
Of course, even if treatment under coercion is effective, it does not follow that it should be provided
For example, the community might place a higher value on punishing than rehabilitating offenders (Hall, 1997)
A consensus view on drug treatment under coercion prepared for the World Health Organization (Porter et al., 1986) concluded that coerced treatment was legally and ethically justified if and only if: (1) the rights of the individuals were protected by 'due process' (in accordance with human rights principles); and (2) if effective and humane treatment was provided
Due process would require some form of judicial oversight of the coerced treatment process
In the absence of such due process, coerced treatment could become de facto imprisonment without judicial oversight
In the absence of humane care and effectiveness, coerced 'drug treatment' would not meet the World Health Organization (WHO) ethicolegal standard
The uncertain benefits of coerced treatment have led some proponents to argue that offenders should be allowed two 'constrained choices' (Fox, 1992)
The first constrained choice would be whether they participate in drug treatment or not
If they declined to be treated, they would be dealt with by the criminal justice system in the same way 97 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications as anyone charged with the same offence
The second constrained choice would be given to those who agreed to participate in drug treatment: this would be a choice of the type of treatment that they received
There is some empirical support for these recommendations in that there is better evidence for the effectiveness of coerced treatment that requires some degree of 'voluntary interest' by the offender (Gerstein and Harwood, 1990)
The constrained choice condition has three implications
First, as they are regarded as effective and generally available to those outside of the prison or judicial setting, a strong argument exists that pharmacological treatment options, including agonist maintenance, should be included in the range of options that are offered to coerced addicts
There has been a tendency for coerced treatment programmes to only offer 'drugfree' abstinenceoriented treatments which could prevent coerced addicts from accessing the forms of treatment that may be most likely to benefit them (Hall, 1997)
Second, pharmacological treatment options should not be the only options available; there should be a range of drugfree treatment options available for those who do not wish to use pharmacological treatments
Third, the safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness of whatever forms of treatment offered should be rigorously evaluated (National Research Council, 2001)
Ethical issues in coerced addiction treatment also arise from the interaction between the correctional and drug treatment systems (Sheldon, 1987; Skene, 1987; Platt et al., 1988; Reynolds, 1992; Rotgers, 1992)
A major problem is the conflict between the expectations of correctional and treatment personnel about the effectiveness of drug treatment and their understanding of each other's roles and responsibilities
Treatment staff usually regard the drug offender as a client, that is, as someone who should be involved in treatment decisions and the confidence of whose personal information should be respected
Treatment staff expect that their clients will have relapses to drug use which should be dealt with therapeutically rather than punitively
Correctional and judicial personnel, by contrast, often expect treatment to produce enduring abstinence
They see treatment as something directed by the court, and hence regard drug use in treatment as an offence that treatment staff are legally obliged to report
When these expectations of treatment effectiveness are not met and there is little communication between courts and treatment services, judges and magistrates may become sceptical about the value of coerced treatment and reduce their use of it (Baldwin, 1979; Skene, 1987)
The effective and ethical use of coerced drug treatment accordingly requires a shared understanding of the likely benefits of treatment and a clear statement of the roles of correctional and treatment staff
The latter should include agreement upon their respective responsibilities for monitoring and reporting upon an offender's progress in drug treatment
These issues need to be addressed in written protocols that govern interactions between courts and treatment personnel
98 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction Is compulsory addiction treatment ethically acceptable? Compulsory treatment — unconditional, enforced entry to addiction treatment — does not offer a drugdependent individual any choice
This type of coerced treatment involves an extreme violation of an individual's autonomy and liberty
Mandatory treatment has generally involved the confinement of individuals in specialised drugtreatment facilities, or prison hospitals, usually with the goal of attaining abstinence from their drug of addiction (Weisner, 1990; Gostin, 1993; Farabee and Leukefeld, 2001; Klag et al., 2005) (')
Upon successful completion of an abstinence programme, individuals may be released from the facility into some sort of intensely supervised outpatient facility
Failure to comply with any condition of the programme usually results in being readmitted to a secure inpatient facility (Gostin, 1993)
Because compulsory treatment involves a maximal deprivation of liberty, it requires a correspondingly greater ethical and legal justification than other forms of coerced treatment
Arguably, this includes stronger evidence that this form of treatment is effective and that the consequences of not treating the person are serious and very likely to occur (Aronowitz, 1967; Childress et al., 2002)
Given the evidence presented above, it is hard to justify the use of compulsory treatment regimes, for either paternalistic or public good reasons (Leukefeld and Tims, 1988)
Importantly, compulsory treatment programmes completely abolish the autonomy of the individual, and arguably constitute a violation of civil liberties in a manner that contravenes the UN Bill of Human Rights
Coercive diversion strategies, by contrast, are less restrictive because they involve constrained choices
They are accordingly less ethically objectionable than compulsory treatment
A choice not to enter treatment would leave the person to face the judicial system, but with their civil and human rights intact
Another concern with the use of compulsory treatment is the effect that this has on the ability for those seeking treatment to find it
It makes little sense if providing treatment places for compulsory treatment reduces the availability of places for those voluntarily seeking them (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1983; Hall, 1997)
Also, compulsory treatment programmes can increase the burden on programmes that are effective, wellfunded and well resourced
It can also affect staff morale and have a negative impact on what might otherwise be successful treatment centres (Hall, 1997)
(’) Antagonist treatments such as naltrexone detoxification or maintenance are the favoured pharmacological treatment methods in such situations
The advent of sustained release formulations of naltrexone or opioid vaccines may be particularly attractive to proponents of compulsory treatment regimes (Caplan, 2006)
The ethics of these forms of treatment will be discussed below
99 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Treating vulnerable populations The negative impact that addiction and drug abuse has on others in society can complicate treatment
This is particularly true of two groups within society where the harms caused to others raise strong emotions: pregnant women and prisoners
These two populations are particularly vulnerable to unjustified discrimination that can lead to neglect of their basic human rights and poor treatment outcomes
Addiction treatment during pregnancy The treatment of substance abuse or addiction during pregnancy presents difficult challenges
Substance abuse during pregnancy is a significant problem
In the USA, almost 5 % of pregnant women under the age of 44 have abused illicit drugs in the last month, 10 % have abused alcohol; and up to 18 % of pregnant women are smokers (SAMSHA, 2004)
The use of licit and illicit drugs during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the mother and the developing foetus (NordstromKlee et al., 2002; Day and Richardson, 2004)
Substance abuse during pregnancy can increase the risk of medical complications during birth (Huestis and Choo, 2002) and produce neurocognitive deficits in children that may persist for the life of the individual
Individuals born to substance using mothers may suffer from significant structural brain abnormalities (e.g
significant neuronal loss and smaller brains)
Alcohol use in pregnancy may produce a foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) that is associated with behavioural and cognitive impairment (Ikonomidou et al., 2000; Olney, 2004)
Persistent attentional and cognitive deficits may appear in early adolescence as a result of prenatal cocaine exposure (Singer et al., 2004a)
Memory and attention may be impaired as a result of structural changes in subcortical regions in the children of methamphetamine abusing mothers (Chang et al., 2004)
Also, children born to a substance using mother may experience withdrawal symptoms after birth (Godding, 2004)
Most jurisdictions will impose limits on the autonomy of individuals when their behaviour results in a significant and likely harm to others
An extreme example is the overriding of a competent patient's refusal of treatment as the only way of preventing the spread of an infectious disease
Although such measures involve a serious interference with autonomy, authorisation is normally justified through compelling counterconcerns of the public interest
The case of pregnant mothers is different, however, because the counterclaim is not for the interests of the public, but those of the foetus
With regard to the mother's use of drugs, two issues come to the fore: the foetal interests and the maternal lifestyle
Both signal a duty on the part of the mother towards the unborn child, and a statemandated limit to the freedom of the personal behaviour of the mother
In the case of the former, in many jurisdictions the criminal liability of the mother has been lacking — the foetus does not have a legal status in the eyes of the law and therefore there is no statutory basis for any criminal charge (Mason et al., 2005)
Likewise, there have 100 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction been few courts willing to protect the interests of the foetus to the extent necessary to limit the freedom of the mother
The problem, as the courts have seen it, is that protecting the 'vulnerable' foetus — even when it may be seriously harmed by the mother's use of drugs during pregnancy — would restrict the mother's autonomy to the extent that it would involve conflicts of fundamental rights (Mason et al., 2005)
Thus, in England and Canada, it has been held that the courts have no jurisdiction to place controls on the autonomy of pregnant woman or deprive them of their liberty, right to selfdetermination, and bodily integrity ( 3 )
Furthermore, forcing mothers to undergo treatment without their consent, involving forced restraint and confinement, could possibly be seen as torture or degrading treatment, and thus may directly evoke human rights doctrine
However, it could be argued that because society has to deal with the health and social consequences of babies affected by maternal drug and alcohol use, then the state has the right to intervene to prevent harm to the unborn
Society already intervenes in a variety of ways to promote the health of the foetus, e.g
by encouraging mothers to take folic acid supplements during pregnancy and offering antenatal classes and antenatal screening for major birth defects
Coercion is used to overcome the difficulty in getting pregnant women into treatment, or refraining from drug use while pregnant
In the USA, there has been significant public support for state intervention, including criminal prosecution, incarceration and forced treatment of pregnant women who abuse drugs (Campbell and Fleischman, 1992)
Likewise, the foetus has been protected from the actions of the mother in New Zealand, where the foetus has been made a ward of the court ( 4 )
Societies have tended to reject approaches that would penalise mothers for actions during pregnancy which might harm their unborn child; the notable exceptions are where apparently immoral behaviour has influenced opinion
For example, most countries allow abortion under strict controls, and have rejected socalled 'wrongful life' suits
There is a clear indication that the unborn life has different interests than those of born individuals: for example, the Council of Europe has stated that an unborn foetus does not have the same right s as a born individual, including a right to life ( 5 )
The spectre of eugenics and the prospect of children suing their parents for negligence are considered by many to be stern warnings against taking such a coercive or punitive approach to maternal behaviour during pregnancy

( 4 ) In 'Nikki's Case', the foetus was given personhood to the extent that, although the mother could not be ordered to do something against her wishes by the court, it could make orders forbidding her to do things that would harm the child (see Skegg et ah, 2006)
In 2006, a District Court confined a pregnant woman to hospital to undergo methadone treatment and was then held in a residential placement until the birth of her baby
The order was justified against her wishes by the judge on the grounds of the 'health and safety of this young woman and her unborn child'

101 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications At the very least, in order to justify compulsory treatment of pregnant substance abusers, intervention must be shown to be effective and not present any additional harm
There are two major utilitarian objections to compulsory treatment of pregnant women: (1) the stress and anxiety associated with forced detention or medical intervention (Ridgely et al., 2004), or the experience of intense withdrawal symptoms (Fiscella et al., 2005) can have serious adverse effects on the mother and foetus; and (2) the threat of compulsory treatment programmes may deter women from presenting themselves early for prenatal care and preterm health checks in order to avoid compulsory detention or intervention (Harwood and Myers, 2004)
Both of these outcomes could adversely affect the health and welfare of the child and mother in ways that may offset any benefits of coerced treatment
Further issues concern the stripping away of the rights of the mother and the state's supposed role in protecting the interests of the unborn foetus
Emerging treatments, such as drug vaccines and implantable antagonists like naltrexone can be provided in ways that do not require detention
But these treatments may still be administered forcibly and without consent, leading to maternal stress and anxiety that could adversely affect the pregnancy
In this report, it has already been suggested that addicts do not necessarily lack autonomy at all times
Therefore, there would be no case of forced treatment in their best interests except in emergency situations (i.e
when they are intoxicated)
Forced 'treatment' may also be considered as 'torture' or 'cruel and inhumane treatment' under European and Member States' human rights law
Even if this treatment were to be used without the consent of the mother, these technologies would require a rigorous evaluation of the potential side effects — both medical and psychological — before being used in pregnant women
There is also the possibility of adverse effects on the developing foetus, such as on the activity of endogenous neurochemicals (e.g
endorphins and dynorphins), which are unknown, and could have effects that last a lifetime
An analysis of efficacy would also need to consider the effects of any attempts to circumvent these forms of prophylaxis, such as physically removing the implants (e.g
extracting subcutaneous drug implants) or attempting to overcome the immunological blockade of a vaccine (e.g
by consuming greater quantities of their preferred drug or choosing to use other illicit drugs whose effects were not blocked by the vaccine or antagonist)
Either outcome could potentially lead to greater drug use, and therefore increased harm to the mother and foetus
The use of an addiction treatment option in consenting mothers is to be welcomed; it reflects the moral responsibilities towards the foetus that the mother has taken on and she should be supported in this endeavour
Given the potential harms from forced treatment of pregnant women, a strong argument exists that treatment programmes should rely on less restrictive and coercive forms of treatment that do not override the autonomous decisionmaking of the mother
This may involve improving engagement with clinicians and education, reinforcing abstinence using vouchers, offers of free prophylactic support to prevent relapse, less punitive responses to positive drug tests and offers of effective and safe substitution treatments (Ward et al., 1999)
102 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction Addiction treatment in prisons A number of commentators have argued that the treatment of addiction and injecting drug use within prison is an area of public policy requiring reform (Jurgens and Betteridge, 2005)
In many countries, current approaches appear often to be inadequate, and are largely dominated by punitive responses to prisoners who are addicted to or use illicit drugs
In general, and despite some innovative programmes and increasing policy concern, very few prisons provide effective treatment for addiction and few have introduced measures to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS and HCV
This is despite a general overrepresentation of addiction and drug abuse by those incarcerated and high rates of HIV and HCV infection within prisons (Hammett, 1988)
In one study of European prisons, up to 34 % of those incarcerated reported injecting drugs during their detention and up to 21 % of these began injecting while in prison (EMCDDA, 2002) although considerable differences exist between prisons in respect to reported levels of drug use and injecting in European prisons
High rates of injecting drug use in prisons are seen in other countries as well (Jurgens and Betteridge, 2005)
HIV rates in prisons are also often much higher than in the general population although the number infected can vary markedly between countries and prisons (Jurgens and Betteridge, 2005)
HCV infection rates are even higher among those reporting drug injection (Dolan, 1999; Macalino, 2004) and in some prisons a significantly high proportion of inmates report sharing injection equipment during incarceration (EMCDDA, 2002)
Human rights declarations and legally binding instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), state that restrictions on the rights of prisoners should only include those necessary for their incarceration
People incarcerated should only have the right to liberty restricted as per their sentence
They should not be subjected to violations of other rights, such as the right to health, life and the right to be free from cruel and inhumane treatment
Their punishment should not include the arbitrary restriction of these rights, and they should not be subject to the double jeopardy of 'punishment' for drug addiction
Prisoners should not be discriminated against by virtue of their status as prisoners; they are entitled to 'equivalence' in treatment
Therefore, as the WHO and United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) guidelines state: prisoners should have access to the same medical health care that is available to the broader public (World Health Organization, 1993a; UNAIDS, 2006)
An increasing number of commentators have argued that these extrajudicial punishments not only violate the human rights of those imprisoned, but also lead to further harm for prison staff and the general public (World Health Organization, 1993a; Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, 2004; Jurgens and Betteridge, 2005; UNAIDS, 2006; UNODC, 2006)
Despite unambiguous directions from bodies such as the UNCHR, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and the WHO, the rate of 103 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications change in this area has been slow
These guidelines animate a number of human rights instruments that would appear to be relatively explicit about the types of treatment and health programmes that should be offered to prisoners to treat addiction and reduce the harm of drug use (United Nations General Assembly, 1955; United Nations General Assembly, 1988; United Nations General Assembly, 1990)
The ICCPR is also clear on this matter: prisoners have the legal right not to be subjected to cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment and the right to the highest attainable standard of mental health
Often, addicted prisoners receive little or no treatment for their condition
Many undergo forced, unsupervised detoxification, or 'cold turkey', which can produce intense withdrawal symptoms, including nausea and extreme diarrhoea, convulsion, anxiety and dysphoria, may cause serious medical consequences for pregnant women and their foetuses, immunocompromised individuals, and those with other comorbid medical disorders (Fiscella et al., 2005)
The stress of prison life, compounded by the onset of severe opioid withdrawal can also increase the risk of suicide, particularly those with comorbid mental illnesses, which are commonly found among prison inmates (United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 2005)
As opiate substitution programmes are often not available in prison, prisoners who are stabilised on methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment prior to entering prison can be forced to go through detoxification and withdrawal
The failure to provide effective pharmacological treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of withdrawal can even be viewed as a violation of the right not to be subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment or punishment as forced detoxification would generally be regarded as unacceptable in the wider community
Given that the freedom and liberty of prisoners are restricted by the state, they are unable to take action themselves to prevent symptoms of withdrawal (Lines, 2006)
This can be seen as placing a further ethical obligation on the state to ensure that these symptoms are treated (Jurgens and Betteridge, 2005)
The lack of adequate treatment may also create conditions in which there is the risk of increased use of drugs within prison, increasing the associated risks of drug overdose and HIV and HCV infection
The human rights claims for this failure are particularly significant for someone on a legitimate and widely accepted treatment programme prior to incarceration, such as methadone maintenance, who contracts HIV after returning to injecting drug use in prison (Gore and Bird, 1995)
As stated by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 'By entering prisons, prisoners are condemned to imprisonment for their crimes; they should not be condemned to HIV and AIDS.' (United Nations Commission on Human Rights, 1996)
Forced detoxification can also lead to overdose if individuals with no opioid tolerance relapse to opioid use upon release, as many do
Such an outcome could also be viewed as a violation of a prisoner's right to health
104 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction Attempts to reduce the risk of HIV and HCV infection due to intravenous drug use is also inadequate in most prisons
Few prisons currently provide access to sterile injecting equipment
Consequently, prisoners who inject in prison often share needles, or improvised injection equipment
These individuals are at high risk of contracting HIV or HCV
Failure to provide prisoners with methods to avoid these diseases not only denies them access to health measures available to the rest of society, but may violate the right to health and, arguably, even the right to life, given that HIV can result in premature death
In addition to violating prisoners' rights, current approaches to the treatment of addiction and drug use in prisons may be counterproductive from a public health point of view
Most prisoners are only detained for short periods of time, whereupon they are released back into the community, increasing the incidence of HIV and HCV
Prisons have consequently become an incubator of HIV and HCV in society
The present situation existing in many prisons can therefore be viewed as problematic on both ethical/human rights grounds, as well as from a utilitarian, public health perspective
Therefore, as suggested in the ICCPR and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) and explicitly articulated in human rights guidelines (United Nations General Assembly, 1988; United Nations General Assembly, 1990; World Health Organization, 1993a), the treatment of addiction and drug abuse in prisons should consider the following: 1
People in prison should have access to all effective types of treatment of addiction, as substitution programmes, such as methadone and buprenorphine maintenance, are generally available in the community
Evidence from prisons which have introduced substitution programmes shows that they can be effective in reducing HIV and HCV risk behaviour and harms associated with injecting drug use (e.g
overdose) (Dolan et al., 1996; Dolan et al., 2006)
2
As with communitybased treatment, it is also important that adequate doses of methadone or buprenorphine are administered
If a punitive approach to treatment is adopted that results in the prescription of doses insufficient to stabilise patients, this will result in withdrawal and craving that may lead to use of supplemental injection of opioids, and therefore be counterproductive
3
As studies have shown that injecting drugs can occur in prison, consideration is required as to how some harm minimisation measures for IDU, such as bleach or needle exchange programmes, can be provided
Overwhelming evidence shows that these programmes are effective in reducing HIV infections
The human rights principle of equivalence provides a strong argument that inmates should have access to needle exchange programmes, which are widely available to the general public in most countries
105 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications 4
Providing prisoners with access to drugrelated education and counselling is also likely to be important especially given that: many are poorly educated, socially disadvantaged or may suffer from neurocognitive deficits, resulting from criminal and violent behaviour, nonfatal overdoses or their drug use
5
A strong argument also exists that prisoners should have access to HIV testing and counselling, where testing is voluntary and information remains private and confidential
Education has been shown to lead to decreases in harmful drugrelated behaviour and reduced transmission of HIV
Medicalisation of addictive behaviour Medicalisation is the process whereby behavioural or social problems are understood as medical disorders that should be treated medically, often at the expense of social approaches
Some commentators believe that a focus on the genetic and neurobiological basis of behaviour will lead to a 'medicalisation' of stigmatised forms of behaviour including behavioural disorders such as addiction (Conrad, 1992; Verweij, 1999; Press, 2006; Ashcroft et al., 2007) ( 6 )
These commentators argue that medicalisation will lead to an overemphasis of the biological origins of behaviour at the expense of social and psychological explanations
Critics of the medicalisation of behaviour believe that this will adversely affect people who engage in stigmatised forms of behaviour like smoking or other drug abuse (Caron et al., 2005)
If addictions are seen as medical disorders that reflect neurobiological predispositions, these critics argue society will come to rely on medical interventions and neglect social policies that can reduce drug use and addiction (e.g
high taxes, restrictions on sale and access to drugs) (Merikangas and Risch, 2003; Caron et al., 2005; Carlsten and Burke, 2006)
The legal status of drugs affects their price and availability in ways that affect patterns of use and the effects that drug use have on health and public safety and order, including criminal activities that addicts engage in to fund their drug use or that is associated with the production, supply and trafficking of these substances
The medicalisation of addiction may also undermine addicts' preparedness to stop if they come to believe that they are unable to stop because of their neurobiological and genetic traits or fatalism
More evidence is needed to evaluate such claims
It may be that addiction neuroscience encourages individuals to seek treatment, or empowers them to make choices not to use drugs because there is an authoritative scientific explanation of their experiences (Hall et al., 2008)
In the interim, information about 'addiction genes' should be carefully communicated to avoid undermining addicts' belief in their capacity to stop using drugs
( 6 ) Medicalisation of addiction does not require that scientific research finds that addiction is solely a brain disease that is largely the result of our genetic makeup
Rather, it requires that it be seen as such
There are those observers who have already made such claims
Attitudes towards stigmatised conditions such as addiction can often precede scientific evidence
Society and the scientific community need to anticipate these misinterpretations and misrepresentations to prevent ineffective and unethical policy responses
106 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction The medicalisation of addiction also raises the question: should drug policies treat differently those who come from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have different genetic vulnerabilities to addiction? While the moral model often subjects addicts to double jeopardy, an inappropriate emphasis on genetic predispositions and social triggers risks could also undermine health and social responsibility
Social policies need to appropriately acknowledge the social, genetic and environmental causes of addiction
Drug using and addictive lifestyles often (but not always) go hand in hand with poverty and low social status
Both the medical and moral models raise the possibility of targeting atrisk individuals or communities, rather than addressing the criminal and social environments that may increase the risk of addiction
Critics of medicalisation also argue that it could restrict the types of treatments that are provided for addiction
Pharmacological treatments and genetic tests could be marketed to drug addicts for commercial rather than health gains, as some argue has happened with NicoTest — an online genetic test that purports to identify vulnerability to nicotine addiction (GeneWatch UK, 2004; De Francesco, 2006)
Alternatively, addiction neurobiology could be used to market invasive and doubtfully effective 'treatments' that are misleadingly advertised as 'cures' of addiction, and provided at high cost to addicts and their families (e.g
neurosurgery (see box pp
108109) or ultrarapid opioid detoxification (UROD))
The promotion of these technologies is often given credibility by an uncritical use of neuroscientific research of addiction, particularly NIDA's 'chronic and relapsing brain disease model' (see box p
26)
The Internet increases the ability of proponents to promote these treatments
This is particularly relevant for the treatment of addiction, where the consumer is often desperate to quit and vulnerable to exploitation
Critics also argue that the medicalisation of addiction could change the ways in which society thinks about drug use and dependence, and therefore the appropriate means available to treat those with an addiction (Backlar, 1996; Caron et al., 2005)
Such a view could lead to the further stigmatisation of those who are vulnerable to addiction, such as those that possess particular genetic alleles or mutations, or are positive for genetic markers associated with drug abuse (Caron et al., 2005)
On this view, neuroscience and behaviour genetics could lead to both institutionalised discrimination, particularly by courts, educators and employers, and health and life insurers, as well as intensifying more informal modes of stigmatisation (Billings et al., 1992; Rothenberg et al., 1997; Hall and Rich, 2000; Anderlik and Rothstein, 2001; Greely, 2001; Geppert and Roberts, 2005)
It is not clear how realistic these fears may prove to be, but given their potential negative implications they merit further investigation and ongoing vigilance (Caron et al., 2005; Condit et al., 2006; Bennett and Smith, 2007)
107 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Neurosurgical treatments for addiction Up until 200203, Russian and Chinese surgeons used neurosurgical procedures to treat heroin addiction, when international concern forced both countries to abandon the controversial treatment
Three hundred and five patients were reportedly operated on in Russia (Walsh, 2002) and over 500 in China (Xinhua News Agency, 2005)
In China, stereotactic surgery has been used to destroy the nucleus accumbens (Gao et al., 2003), the brain region where the rewarding effects of opioids and other drugs appear to be mediated (Robbins et al., 2007), while Russian neurosurgeons lesioned an area called the cingulate gyrus; a brain region that has previously been removed to treat obsessional disorders (Orellana, 2002)
The aim of the surgery is to interrupt obsessional thoughts about drug use (Orellana, 2002)
A recent report suggests that clinicians in China have recommenced neurosurgical treatment of opioid addiction as part of a clinical trial (Goff, 2005)
These reports raise a number of important ethical concerns (Hall, 2006): 1
There is no compelling reason to use neurosurgery to treat heroin addiction
There are effective forms of treatment that substantially reduce illicit opioid use and stabilise the lives of heroin addicts (e.g
substitution or maintenance treatment on methadone or buprenorphine (Ward et al., 1998; Mattick et al., 2003; Amato et al., 2005)
Patients and practitioners who find opioid agonist maintenance morally objectionable, or who work in settings that prohibit its use, can use the antagonist naltrexone in oral or implantable form (e.g
(Krupitsky et al., 2004))
2
There are major concerns about the safety and efficacy of these neurosurgical procedures
Stereotactic neurosurgery is an invasive procedure that involves drilling holes in the patient's skull and inserting electrodes deep into the brain to destroy the target region
Advocates of these procedures argue that they are less invasive and destructive than older forms of psychosurgery, and report low rates of complications
However, these conclusions are based on uncontrolled studies that do not properly evaluate the cognitive and behavioural effects of destroying such important neurological regions as the NAcc and aCG (Gao et al., 2003; Medvedev et al., 2003)
3
There are major concerns about the effects of producing irreversible lesions in neural centres that are not only implicated in drugmediated reward but in the control of food intake, sexual behaviour and the formation of social bonds, among other pleasures
What effect will these procedures have on the person's responsiveness to reward, their motivation, mood state, risks of depression and suicide and capacity for planned action? What will happen if heroin addicts 108 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction attempt to compensate for the attenuated reward from heroin by increasing their heroin dose to levels that may be lethal in overdose? No attempt has been made to answer these important questions
4
The published evaluations of the procedures were only compared to patients' experiences after detoxification (Gao et al., 2003; Medvedev et al., 2003)
Since relapse to opioid use is common after detoxification, a more informative comparison would have been with a more effective treatment of opioid addiction, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance
However, MMT is not readily available in China (Cohen, 2004) and prohibited by law in Russia (Krupitsky et al., 2004)
There has not even been any attempt to compare its efficacy with oral naltrexone, which has been used in Russia, reportedly with better results than in western countries (Krupitsky et al., 2004)

There are also doubts about whether patients have given free and informed consent to participate in this surgery (Kleinig, 1985)
Chinese policies towards opioid dependence are often punitive, with imprisonment and compulsory detoxification as first line responses
It could be argued that it is difficult to obtain free and informed consent within such a context
Prevention of addiction Predictive testing of genetic liability in addiction In 1999, Francis Collins, Director of the US Human Genome Institute, outlined an optimistic vision of 'genomic medicine': the use of genetic information to improve human health (Collins, 1999; Collins, 2003)
Collins foresaw genomic screening being used preventively to: (1) identify healthy individuals who carry susceptibility alleles for diseases, such as cancers and heart disease and (2) to intervene with those at higher genetic risk to either change their behaviour (e.g
increasing exercise or eating a healthier diet) or to use drugs (e.g
antihypertensives) that reduced their risk of developing these diseases
Collins imagined, for example, screening smokers for genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and counselling those at high risk to stop smoking
Similarly, optimistic projections have been expressed by some addiction genetics researchers (Uhl and Grow, 2004)
If susceptibility genes are identified for addiction risk, then children and adolescents could be genetically tested and those at higher risk given preventive behavioural and pharmacological interventions to reduce their likelihood of using drugs (Collins, 1999)
There is an obvious objection to this proposal in that it is not good public health policy to encourage people to use drugs, regardless of their genetic risk of dependence (Hall et al., 2002)
Chronic drug use can have severe physical or psychological health 109 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications effects without resulting in addiction
An alternative rationale is that such screening would allow individuals who were at highest genetic risk of addiction to make informed decisions about whether to avoid drug use
Even if society places a high value on individual autonomy, there are a number of good reasons why on current information genetic screening for addiction is unlikely to be regarded as a good policy choice (Holtzman and Marteau, 2000)
First, when multiple genes predispose to a common disease, individual susceptibility alleles only predict a very modestly increased risk of dependence (Hall et al., 2004a)
Testing multiple genetic variants that were individually weak predictors would improve prediction if the results of multiple genetic tests were combined (Khoury et al., 2004)
However, the larger the number of genes that are involved in disease susceptibility, the less useful most individuals will find information about their genotype (Hall et al., 2004a; Khoury et al., 2004)
It also means that a very large number of individuals need to be screened to identify the few at highest risk (Vineis et al., 2001)
Second, predictive genetic testing may have unintended adverse effects
This would be the case, for example, if testing adolescents for susceptibility to addiction increased their preparedness to try drugs, as could happen, for example, if they were prompted to test the accuracy of the genetic predictions (Hall et al., 2002)
Third, screening is only ethically justifiable if there is an effective intervention to prevent the disorder in those who are identified as being at increased risk (Khoury et al., 2003)
No such interventions currently exist but the prospect of preventive vaccination against cocaine and nicotine may raise this possibility in the future (Hall and Carter, 2004)
Thirdparty uses of genetic information Genetic information on addiction risk may potentially be used by third parties such as insurance companies, employers and educators, and the courts
Given the nature of genetic transmission, the implications of this information not only affect the individual being tested, but also their close relatives
This raises a number of ethical issues about who should be able to access this information
What measures should be taken to protect privacy? Under what circumstances should this information be shared and with whom (Anderer, 1992; Rothstein, 1998; Rothstein and Anderlik, 2001)? Bioethicists' concerns about the ethical and policy implications of genetic testing have been strongly influenced by experiences with genetic testing for Mendelian disorders, the paradigm case being Huntington's disease (Marteau and Richards, 1996)
Because the mutations that cause this serious neurological disorder are strongly predictive of disease risk, genetic testing creates serious ethical dilemmas for affected individuals and family members (Marteau and Richards, 1996)
Such testing no Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction also raises real concerns about the discriminatory use of genetic risk information by health and life insurers and employers (Billings et al., 1992; Taylor, 1998)
But Huntington's disease is a poor model of the situation that arises with addiction
They are most likely to be polygenic disorders, involving multiple alleles of weak effect and environmental interactions
The predictive validity of genetic testing may only modestly improve upon the crude prognostic tool of family history
Discussion of the ethical implications of the predictive genomics of addiction has to take account of the most likely ways in which genomics information will be used
If the pessimists are right, the ethical and policy issues identified by bioethicists will not arise because research will not identify predictively useful alleles for addiction
Even in the most optimistic scenario, the predictive genomics of addition is unlikely to lead to genetic screening of whole populations for the reasons outlined above
Rather, predictive genetic testing is more likely to be offered to the minority of persons with a family history of early onset addictive disorders, perhaps 10 % of the population
Fear of genetic discrimination may nonetheless deter people with such family histories from having genetic tests that may benefit them
Similar fears may also deter individuals from participating in genetic research on addictive disorders, thereby impairing the acquisition of scientific knowledge about the prevention and treatment of these disorders
It remains to be seen whether community concerns about thirdparty use of genetic information prove to be a major impediment to addiction genomic research and future medical applications
Of course, it is possible to eliminate the risks of thirdparty use of genetic information by banning all genetic tests, but this policy could prevent us from realising any benefits that genetic testing may bring; it would also be an overly paternalistic and arguably unethical policy
A better approach would be to look for safeguards to prevent individuals' privacy and confidentiality being unfairly compromised so that they need not fear breaches of confidentiality and privacy
The challenge will be to develop policies that allow for the use of genetic information to reduce the incidence of disease and improve the health and welfare of individuals and society, while minimising any negative consequences of stigmatisation and discrimination
Vaccines and slow release drug treatments If it is possible to predict genetic liability to drug dependence, society will need to decide if it is ethical to use more coercive means to prevent adolescents from using drugs (Hall et al., 2002)
For example, vaccines being developed against nicotine, primarily for smoking cessation (Ashcroft and Franey, 2004; Harwood and Myers, 2004; Hall, 2005; 111 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Kosten and Owens, 2005), could potentially be used to prevent 'high risk' children and adolescents from smoking (Hall et al., 2002; Ashcroft and Franey, 2004)
In order to be ethical, use of preventive nicotine vaccination would need to demonstrate: (1) the longterm benefits of the vaccine (Hall et al., 2002; Ashcroft and Franey, 2004; Harwood and Myers, 2004) and (2) that genetic tests accurately predict the risk of nicotine addiction
Given the limited predictive power of genes studied to date, and doubts about the longterm efficacy of preventive vaccination (Hall, 2007), it is unlikely that preventive vaccination would be an effective or an ethical intervention (Hall, 2005)
Immunotherapies, such as a 'nicotine vaccine' block the psychoactive effects of a drug by either stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies (active immunisation) or through the introduction of synthetic monoclonal antibodies into the bloodstream (passive immunisation) (Harwood and Myers, 2004)
These antibodies bind to the target drug, preventing it from acting on receptors in the brain (Nutt and LingfordHughes, 2004; Kosten and Owens, 2005)
Animal studies have shown that antidrug vaccines reduce the rush and euphoria associated with the target drug, the amount of drug that reaches the brain, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, the rate of clearance across the bloodbrain barrier, and the volume of drug distribution, and selfadministration of the target drug (Hall, 2002a; Kosten and Owens, 2005)
Vaccines have a very clear advantage over traditional small molecule agonists and antagonists in that they are longlasting, highly specific, and as they remain primarily in the bloodstream, have no apparent central nervous system side effects
These advantages suggest that immunotherapies may be effective in reducing relapse to drug use, a major hurdle in overcoming addiction
Active vaccination against nicotine could reduce relapse to smoking in abstinent smokers during the first few months after quitting when most smokers relapse (Vocci and Chiang, 2001)
A nicotine vaccine could be circumvented by increasing the dose of nicotine but attenuating the rewarding effects of nicotine may be enough to reduce rates of return to daily smoking (Vocci and Chiang, 2001; Hall, 2002a)
Similar vaccines are also being developed for cocaine and heroin
The term 'vaccine' inevitably prompts discussion about its possible preventive use
Misconceptions that a vaccine will produce lifelong immunity against nicotine may prompt parents to vaccinate their children (Cohen, 1997)
As minors, children would not be legally able to consent to vaccination but since parents already make choices for their children about other vaccines and other interventions that affect their lives (e.g
their diet and education), some have argued that vaccination against nicotine and other drugs is simply another decision that parents should be able to make on behalf of their children (Cohen, 1997)
Given that there is a fundamental difference in vaccinations to prevent infection and vaccines to control behaviour, this argument is likely to be contested by civil libertarians and others who place a high value on personal autonomy (Hasman and Holm, 2004), as well as adolescents who disagree with their parents' wishes
112 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction Even if one sets aside the ethical issues, there are major practical obstacles to the preventive use of a nicotine vaccine in children
First, the limited period of protection provided by existing vaccines would require booster injections, perhaps every two or three months throughout adolescence (Kosten et al., 2002)
Second, the fact that the vaccine could be circumvented by using higher doses of nicotine means that vaccination could be counterproductive if adolescents were prompted to test its efficacy
Third, it would be costly to universally vaccinate children against nicotine with a vaccine of modest preventive efficacy (Hall, 2002a)
Vaccination of 'high risk' adolescents seems a more plausible and less expensive option
The feasibility of even this approach is doubtful, however, given the low predictive validity of genetic screening for smoking risk (outlined above), the doubtful preventive efficacy of a nicotine vaccine, and the possible adverse effects of vaccination, such as stigmatisation of those who screened positive and discrimination against them by third parties, such as life or health insurance companies
The 'off label' use of a drug vaccine by a physician acting at the request of a parent is the most likely way in which a vaccine will be used preventively
It is difficult to see how this could be prevented if a nicotine vaccine is approved for therapeutic use, other than by education of physicians and parents about the likely limitations and possible disadvantages of this approach (Hall, 2002b)
In addition to these practical issues, the use of immunotherapies also raises several ethical concerns
Firstly, individuals would have to give fully informed consent
It is likely that immunotherapies would be most often used in situations that are inherently coercive, as treatment will often be the result of encounters with the justice system, such as a condition of release from prison or to avoid incarceration, in pregnant women, or parents involved in the child welfare system
The benefits will need to be balanced against rights of the individual to privacy and liberty (Ashcroft and Franey, 2004)
Secondly, vaccines may also prove counterproductive if an individual attempts to overcome the antagonistic action of the vaccine by increasing drug dose
Those who ambivalently agree to vaccination may later switch to using other possibly more dangerous drugs, different routes of administration (e.g
intravenous injection), or much higher than usual doses (Murray, 2004)
Vaccines may also paradoxically make experimentation with drugs seem less risky, and therefore unwittingly increase drug use
The likelihood of this occurring should not be underestimated given the compulsion and motivation to use drugs displayed by some individuals, even in the face of certain negative consequences
The use of vaccines under any form of coercion will therefore require careful monitoring by the treating physician
Thirdly, vaccines will produce longlasting (possibly lifelong) markers that will be detectable in the blood and urine, and may lead to false positive drug tests (Murray, 2004)
This raises the issue of confidentiality and discrimination which could discourage some from seeking immunotreatment
113 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Fourthly, vaccines do not ameliorate underlying problems that may be associated with compulsive drug use and addiction
Vaccines may be problematic if viewed as 'magic bullets'
They do not deal with the underlying addictive condition (such as craving, loss of control or withdrawal), events that may lead to relapse, or comorbid mental conditions (Ashcroft and Franey, 2004)
Addiction is a chronic condition and vaccines, like traditional addiction medications, will presumably need to be used in conjunction with behavioural treatments if lifelong abstinence is to be achieved (Nutt and Lingford Hughes, 2004)
Many will be wary of a treatment that prevents them from using drugs to either relieve withdrawal symptoms or to attenuate the symptoms of an undiagnosed mental illness (McGregor and Gallate, 2004), other subclinical conditions involving distress, or the effects of a stressful or abusive social situation
This is not to uncritically accept selfmedication as an explanation of addiction (Mueser et al., 1998), but to acknowledge that psychological and social factors may sustain drug use in ways that vaccination alone will not address
Finally, the use of a vaccine may also block the action of agonists or partial agonists (e.g
methadone and buprenorphine for opioid dependence) eliminating the use of maintenance therapies while vaccination remained effective
Vaccines may also block the action of medications used in the treatment of other physiological conditions (e.g
opioid analgesics for pain relief) (Ashcroft and Franey, 2004)
Relapse prevention and maintenance with depot medications Depot medications are sustainedrelease formulations of current medications for treating addiction, most often antagonists that block the brain receptors for the target drugs
They involve a slow, timed release of the medication to counteract the rewarding effects of drugs
Depot medications have an advantage over traditional treatment medications as they are only required to be taken once a month, as compared to three to four times a week for conventional orally administered drugs
This has made depot medications an attractive option in preventing relapse
Sustainedrelease preparations of the antagonists naltrexone for alcohol and opioid dependence (Kranzler et al., 1998; Comer et al., 2002) and lofexidine for nicotine dependence (Rawson et al., 2000) have been developed
If these treatments are used with patients who give free and informed consent, their use arguably presents no special ethical issues
Ethical issues do arise if sustained release antagonists are used to prevent relapse in situations where capacity to give free consent is compromised
Depot medications raise similar ethical questions as vaccines (see pp
11113) if used under coercion, as has recently been advocated (Caplan, 2006)
Depot antagonists also present similar safety concerns if addicts change to using other illicit drugs or attempts to overcome their antagonist effects by increasing the dose of their preferred drug (Murray, 2004)
114 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction Currently, in virtually all EU Member States substitution treatment is available for opiate dependence (Hedrich et al, 2008)
However, the availability of treatment varies between countries and among the general public and some policymakers remain opposed to the use of agonist drugs in addiction treatment
This raises a potential concern that the treatment choice could be limited to depot medications, such as the antagonist naltrexone, or that addicts will be coerced into using implantable naltrexone and not offered other forms of treatment, even where a good evidence base exists that they can be effective
In Australia, depot medications have been implanted in thousands of patients without clinical trials being conducted to demonstrate that they are safe or effective
This raises important concerns, as clearly the safety and efficacy of these and all other treatments, should be evaluated rigorously, as is the case for all other pharmacological treatments, prior to their use clinically
Challenges for public education Popular understandings of the role of genetics, at least as expressed in the media, are often deterministic, suggesting that if you have 'the gene for X' you are very likely to develop that disorder and conversely that you will be at low risk of doing so if you do not have the 'gene' for that disorder (Khoury et al., 2000)
For example, popular media reporting of a commercially available pharmacogenetic test for choosing either NRT or bupropion for smoking cessation, the NicoTest (www.nicotest.com), describes it as a test for 'the smoker's gene' or the 'addiction gene' (BBC News, 2004; Doyle, 2004)
These views probably reflect the media focus on Mendelian disorders like Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis and TaySachs disease, where modes of genetic transmission are easier to understand (Khoury et al., 2000)
If these views are indeed widely held, the challenge for public education will be explaining the personal and public health implications of polygenic disorders in which individual alleles weakly predict risk, and interact with each other and with the person's environment
If done well, this type of public education may allay anxieties about the thirdparty uses of genetic information
Public education will also need to avoid any unintended message that public health drug control strategies can be replaced by high risk genomic medicine strategies (Willett, 2002; Merikangas and Risch, 2003; Carlsten and Burke, 2006)
The surest way for many individuals in developed societies to reduce their disease risks remains to stop drug use, reduce caloric intake and increase exercise (Rose, 1992; Peto, 2001; Vineis et al., 2001; Merikangas and Risch, 2003)
If society is to avoid blaming individuals for their risk status we also need to modify our physical and social environments in ways that facilitate desirable changes in risk behaviour
115 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Drug screening and testing Drug testing involves biochemical testing of blood, urine, hair and saliva for drugs, or their metabolites
It can tell if an individual has used a drug within a particular time period and, in some cases, whether they are intoxicated
Many would maintain that drug testing does not raise any major ethical issues if a person's drug use puts others at risk (e.g
when they are driving a motor vehicle, flying a plane, or operating machinery)
In these cases, drug testing is ethically justified if there is evidence that: (1) drug use impairs performance in ways that endanger others; (2) the drug testing provides valid assessment of impairment; and (3) drug testing deters people from using drugs in ways that put others at risk
These conditions are satisfied, for example, when blood alcohol concentration is used to test for impairment in automobile, train and truck drivers, and pilots
Testing in the workplace and other settings for drug use rather than intoxication, raises additional ethical issues (Allsop, 1997)
Workplace testing may have primary goals of reducing employer costs (health and sick leave) and increasing productivity, as opposed to ensuring the safety of employees or the public
There is very little evidence that this kind of drug testing achieves these goals (Allsop, 1997)
Moreover, in the USA, workplace drug testing is often confined to testing for metabolites of illegal drugs (particularly cannabis which is easiest to detect) (DeCew, 1994) rather than alcohol, which is much more commonly used and much more likely to impair work performance
In this type of testing impairment has not been demonstrated (Allsop, 1997), and concerns are raised about the right to privacy and confidentiality, workers' freedom to consent to testing, and discrimination and stigmatisation of workers who screen positive for drug use rather than impairment (Allsop, 1997)
There are many other populations which may be targets for screening and testing
The acceptance of screening requires a balance between the public good (protecting individuals from the irresponsible actions of others, public health goals, detecting illegal activities), and individual liberty and privacy
Where the balance lies often depends on the type of drug being tested or screened for, the context of use, and the aims of testing
There are substantial ethical differences between testing, for example, in schools and workplaces; likewise there are also different ethical considerations between testing in elite sports, the military service or commercial pilots
For example, a recent study of drug testing in schools concluded that: 'The use of such tests in school may undermine the confidence necessary for a good pedagogic and educational relationship between teachers, parents and pupils
Testing in schools may conflict with ethical principles such as individual autonomy and respect for privacy, to the extent that they are unjustified intrusions by the state or other authorities into young citizens' private lives that expose them to humiliating or ambiguous situations
116 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction Such tests may also infringe the beneficence — or doing good — principle, since it is doubtful whether the benefit of carrying out tests in schools for preventive purposes outweighs the disbenefits for the young persons concerned, and the nonmaleficence — or not doing harm — principle, since the young persons would always suffer unnecessary inconvenience from being subjected to such tests' ( 7 )
In sports, the question of justified testing comes down to satisfying a number of issues surrounding drug use, as it is: (a) contrary to the spirit of sport, (b) unfair, and (c) dangerous for the athlete's health (according to the World AntiDoping Agency's Code, 2003) ( 8 )
Opponents of antidoping policies question all of these criteria for existing drugs
They emphasise the use of coercion, the encroachments on privacy and the autonomy of professional competitors, and reject claims that drug use undermines the primacy of 'authenticity' and the 'sports ethos' (e.g
by achieving success through using drugs rather than via 'natural' means, such as training, practice and hard work) ( 9 )
In these examples, screening and drug testing raise different ethical issues in different settings and when carried out with different purposes and goals
This makes it difficult to provide authoritative opinions on possible future developments in drug monitoring
Each new development will need to be considered as it arises
Neuroscience, prediction and privacy Neuroimaging may prove a useful clinical tool in the diagnosis and treatment of addiction by identifying individuals with subtypes of addiction and comorbid mental disorders who may require different combinations of treatment
These uses do not present special ethical issues but the ability to identify the neural correlates of addiction may have other uses outside the clinic that do
For example, neuroimaging studies are able to detect dramatic changes in limbic responses to drugrelated cues that would identify an individual as drug dependent (Childress et al., 1999)
This opens up the possibility of discrimination and violations of privacy (Canli and Amin, 2002; Farah and Wolpe, 2004; llles and Racine, 2005)
It may also raise issues of consent, given that these neuroimaging tests could use drug cues that are presented without the subject's awareness (Whalen et al., 1998) ( ,0 )
Given the enormous costs associated with addiction, this use of the technology may be attractive to employers, insurance companies and courts
Because the changes in the limbic regions that respond to ( 7 ) Taken from Pompidou Group Expert Committee on Ethics, 2005

( 10 ) It is possible to mask images by presenting them for intervals that are too short to be perceived consciously so that the viewer is not aware of having viewed the image while producing changes in neural activity that can be detected by neuroimaging
117 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications drugrelated cues persist well into abstinence, there is the possibility that an individual will be discriminated against even when they are drugfree
The fairness of such a discriminatory policy would need to be established
Advances in neuroimaging technologies raise the possibility of 'reading people's minds' by using these methods to ascertain the truthfulness of what defendants or suspects tell the police (Farah, 2002; Foster et al., 2003; Ross, 2003)
This is more of an aspiration than reality at present, although some entrepreneurs claim that electrophysiological methods can be used to tell if a person is telling the truth (Foster et al., 2003)
Future improvements in neuroimaging may, even if imperfectly, disclose facts about a person that they may prefer to keep private (Ross, 2003)
Advances in neuroimaging technology are making it possible to obtain personal information about an individual that may predict behaviour or identify aspects of personality (Fischer et al., 1997; Fischer et al., 2001; Canli and Amin, 2002; Farah and Wolpe, 2004; Singer et al., 2004b; Abler et al., 2005)
The claims of entrepreneurs promoting these technologies to the public (e.g
truth telling, personality matching and as tests of marital fidelity) raise the issue of the need for appropriate consumer protection against the over or misinterpretation of equivocal test results and bogus claims (Caplan, 2002; Farah, 2002; Farah, 2005)
Important ethical issues would be raised if persons are compelled to undergo these tests by courts, insurance companies or employers
During the course of neuroimaging studies, up to 40 % of brain scans of research participants show 'suspicious' brain anomalies, with between 0.5 to 8 % of research brain scans uncovering clinically significant neuropathologies (llles et al., 2004b; llles et al., 2006b)
The emergence of incidental findings from neuroimaging research can lead to discrimination, which complicates consent to participate in these studies (llles et al., 2004a; Anon, 2005; llles et al., 2006b)
This issue is amplified if imaging is conducted under coercion
Neuroscience investigations may also provide information that proves to be predictive of disease risk in the same way as genes for Mendelian disorders like Huntington's disease (Greely, 2002; Foster et al., 2003)
Characteristic patterns of brain activity in childhood and adolescence, for example, may predict increased risks of addiction later in adult life (Volkow et al., 2003)
This possibility raises the same ethical issues (e.g
privacy and discrimination) that are raised by testing for alleles that predict an increased risk of serious neurological disease (Greely, 2002)
There are also subtler questions of human rights to consider
The increased use of these methods lead to the development of the belief that a refusal of a 'suspect' to undertake these fMRI on civil liberties grounds is indicative of 'guilt'
Psychopharmacological harm reduction Neuroscience research on addiction could potentially be used to engineer safer recreational drugs
It may be possible, for example, to use pharmacology and neuroscience to engineer a recreational drug that was a safer alternative to alcohol 118 Chapter 5: New developments in the treatment of addiction (Nutt, 2006)
Nutt persuasively argues that it is technically possible to develop a gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) partial agonist that possesses most of the socially desirable properties of alcohol with few of its disadvantages, including its biological toxicity
The major obstacles to any such product being introduced are social, ideological and regulatory
This is true for any of the ways in which such a drug may be introduced into developed societies; namely, by being approved for use as a therapeutic drug, or being manufactured and distributed by freelance psychopharmacologists
There are major doubts about whether the pharmaceutical industry will invest the substantial funds needed to: (1) undertake preclinical and clinical R&D on such a drug and (2) to sponsor the drug's passage through the pharmaceutical regulatory systems, such as the US Food and Drug Administration or its British and European equivalents
Attempts have been made to introduce alcohollike drugs in the recent past
The recent Foresight Brain Science, Addiction and Drugs project's survey of pharmaceutical executives (Ragan, 2007) suggests that the industry is now more risk averse
This has been partly in response to critics who have accused the pharmaceutical industry of 'selling sickness' to promote drugs such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), Viagra and the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) antidepressants (e.g
(Healy, 2004; Moynihan and Cassels, 2005))
The regulatory system is also likely to discourage any attempt to introduce such a drug as a harm reduction intervention in alcoholdependent patients
Experience with substitute prescribing for nicotine dependence reveals a regulatory double standard that insists upon much tighter regulations for less harmful nicotine products than are imposed on the far more dangerous smoked tobacco products (Stratton et al., 2001)
These regulations provide major disincentives to pharmaceutical harm reduction approaches
It could be argued that the prevailing regulatory philosophy sometimes seems to be that a patient's health is less important than being drug dependent, even if this means being dependent on a less hazardous drug or a less harmful way of using it
Safer recreational drugs may emerge as a byproduct of basic pharmacological research or they may be approved for therapeutic use for an unrelated indication in which case their desirable properties may be discovered by amateur psychopharmacologists
If these drugs prove relatively easy to produce using widely available precursors, then recipes disseminated via the Internet may be used for home production, as has happened with GHB (Gahlinger, 2004) and other substances (EMCDDA (in press) Risk assessment 8: 'Report on the risk assessment of BZP in the framework of the Council Decision on new psychoactive substances')
The experience with GHB suggests that if this were to happen, a likely regulatory response would be to explore options to restrict the availability of the substances commonly through making it an offence to produce, sell or use it
In Europe, Council Decision 2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 provides the basis for an early warning system where new psychoactive substances with no medicinal use may be subject to risk 119 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications assessment and subsequent control (")
During the 20th century, the recreational use of drugs with psychoactive effects that resemble alcohol to at least some extent, (cannabis, ecstasy, benzodiazepines and GHB) has prompted their prohibition by classifying them as controlled substances under international drug control treaties (McAllister, 2000)
Clearly, the potential development and marketing of new psychoactive substances for recreational purposes, or as substitutes to existing commonly used illicit or licit existing substances, is likely to raise difficult questions on future policy in this area
Currently major social and regulatory barriers and challenges exist that inhibit the development and marketing of new psychoactive substances for recreational use
However these are already being challenged on a number of fronts and this is likely to continue with the Internet now creating a global marketplace in which regulatory frameworks in many areas are either complicated or under challenge
Moreover, there may be good public health and scientific arguments for continuing to explore the possibility of the development of a 'safer tipple' or less damaging substitutes for tobacco or even illicit drugs
A wider public discussion of the possibility is also well worthwhile for its educational value in reminding citizens in developed countries that: their favourite recreational drug alcohol affects brain chemistry in the same way as many prohibited drugs; it is an extremely toxic substance when used to excess, as it so often is; and is a major cause of violence, injury and social disorder, especially among young adults

120 Chapter 6 Conclusions and possible implications of advances in addiction neurobiology for future drug policies Benjamin Capps, Adrian Carter, Wayne Hall, David Nutt, Richard Ashcroft and Ruud ter Meulen There is a consensus within European Union policy that the approach to drug control should be balanced, comprehensive and focus simultaneously on the need for demand reduction, supply reduction, the fight against trafficking and international cooperation
It combines action at a number of levels: • within the framework of European Community competence (public health, precursor control, money laundering, development aid); • close cooperation between Member States (foreign policy, justice and home affairs); • partnerships with Member States, other states and international organisations
The potential developments mentioned in this report raise issues that are likely to become important for policymakers within Member States and will require careful consideration at European level in regard to the EU's role
They raise important questions for both drug policy and human rights and may have implications for the future regional role of the EU in developing policies, monitoring the activities of Member States and taking appropriate action with regard to Member States' policies
The EU itself may use monitoring and prevention technologies in controlling the criminal aspects of drug use (such as trafficking) and their effects on public health
The EU has already taken affirmative action with regard to tobacco and alcohol in respect to public health
It is not the purpose of this report to comment upon the fact that some drugs (e.g
amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine and heroin) are illicit while others with similar effects (alcohol and tobacco) are not
The psychoactive substances discussed in Chapter 3 will be classified according to existing policies
For example, the drugs described in this chapter may similarly represent the 'particular dangers inherent' in existing illicit drugs; (’) a leading cautious presumption is that: 'New psychoactive substances can be harmful to health' ( 2 )

123 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications There are positive uses of currently illicit drugs and some argue that the harms from illicit drugs have been overplayed, while those of currently licit ones have been underplayed (Nutt et al., 2007b)
Drug policies have always been controversial, especially with regard to the legal status of currently illicit drugs
Much of this stems from the criminal behaviour that is linked to some forms of illicit drug use
The act of using a drug and the risk of addiction have been used to justify paternalistic government policies that prohibit the use of some drugs (Hunt, 2003; Kleinig, 2004)
Policies, therefore, reflect some of the harms of some types of drug use but it is the 'recreational' use of illicit drugs that has largely shaped our 'medical' policies
There is compelling evidence that widespread use of many licit and illicit drugs has massive economic and social costs but their links to crime and social problems are not always straightforward
The distinction between use for therapeutic and recreational reasons has significant sociopolitical consequences
An approach grounded in neurobiology will affect policies in ways that are difficult to anticipate
It may reduce the reliance on policies that aim to avoid harm and increase support for a disease model of addiction
It may lead to a more rational approach to the harms caused by drug use rather than policies based on cultural and historical agendas
In the best of all possible worlds, addiction neurobiology may allow us to reconsider our social responses to the minority of drug users who become addicted by reducing their stigmatisation and increasing their access to more effective psychological and biological treatments; but an improved understanding of the neurobiology of addiction will not relieve us of the obligation to prevent problem drug use in some youth populations
Policies will, therefore, still need to aim to reduce the number of troubled young and otherwise vulnerable people who are susceptible to the appeal of all forms of drug use by reducing the social conditions that contribute to their vulnerability
The implications of new developments, or potential new developments in addiction neuroscience are likely to have implications for future drugs policy in a number of important areas
1) Neurobiological research on addiction is revealing complex interactions between drugs of addiction, biological responses to them, and the social circumstances of drug users
As this work develops over the next decade, more work will be required to build upon the current research by more systematically exploring the social and ethical implications of addiction neurobiology and its application to the treatment and prevention of addiction
2) Appropriate societal responses to drug use and addiction will need to give due consideration to 'disease' models of addiction while still acknowledging the social conditions that lead to drug use and the choices that individuals make to use drugs
3) Policies towards drug use and addiction will continue to need to address both their public health and criminal justice consequences
124 Chapter 6: Conclusions and possible implications of advances in addiction neurobiology 4) The autonomy of addicts is variable so care is required in using medical, paternalistic and criminal measures to control and treat addiction
If an addict is conceptualised as being wholly without autonomy, which is not the case in lucid periods, then human rights and appropriate ethical values are likely to take a back seat to the public interest
When autonomy is seriously impaired, it may be appropriate to take paternalistic measures to protect addicts from harming themselves or others
Responses to addiction need to include both punitive measures (i.e
in response to the autonomy and responsibilities of drug users) and improved access to addiction treatment
5) The autonomy of addicts is impaired by their addiction but not usually sufficiently so to warrant strong paternalistic interventions that override their wishes
Treatment of addiction should aim to build on and support addicts' autonomy and ensure that their consent to treatment is as informed and given as freely as possible
6) A major challenge for addiction policy and ethics will be finding ways to educate the public about the neurobiological basis of addiction in ways that recognise that drug use and addiction are nonetheless affected by individual and social choices
7) Strong public interest in neuroscientific research on addiction and the potential for misunderstandings mean that addiction neuroscientists should disseminate their findings responsibly and accurately, anticipate potential misinterpretations and proactively engage with the media and politicians
8) While many of the prospective developments in neuroscience will support measures of addiction treatment, prevention and monitoring, the potential limitations of a neuroscientific approach also need to be considered
Although this report has not dealt in detail with the social responses to addiction, future policies should continue with those current methods that are successfully tackling aspects of drug addiction, while integrating potentially new methods that emerge from addiction neuroscience
9) All new treatments and preventive interventions for addiction should be rigorously evaluated for safety and efficacy before being introduced into routine practice
10) Equitable access to treatment should not disproportionately deny human rights, privacy, consent or liberty to satisfy criminalfocused public opinion
Addicts are already vulnerable, and often live in disadvantaged situations
This should not be compounded by discrimination and stigmatisation
11) The EU's current Drugs Strategy (200512) provides a balanced approach to drug control with a focus on both reducing illicit drug trafficking and dealing with problem 125 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications users
Future developments in addiction neuroscience may assist in reducing the prevalence of illegal drug use and levels of drug dependence while promoting public health and improving social conditions that are associated with drug use
To ensure that the benefits from any developments in this area deliver maximum benefit and that potential problems are anticipated and avoided, an ongoing debate is required that considers how novel developments in neuroscience may affect current and future policies at both Member State and European level
Specific policy implications Although developments in neuroscience offer the possibility of allowing individuals to be more autonomous with regard to their future decisions, care should be taken to minimise any adverse effects on human rights
Therefore, further research will be required to ensure that these developments are taken forward with adequate ethical safeguards for human rights and with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance between the ethical values of autonomy, consent, liberty, equality and privacy
Areas that require specific consideration include: Genetic data While gene chips containing personal data on susceptibilities may provide important medical benefits, access to such data could potentially lead to stigmatisation and discrimination if inappropriately used
This is currently highly speculative technology and it is important that it not be rolled out without sufficient empirical evidence demonstrating its efficacy and appropriate attention given to data protection issues
Vaccinations Vaccines and slow release formulations of antagonist drugs are potentially useful treatments that may assist addicts to remain abstinent
The longterm potential of vaccines in particular is currently unclear
However, even if this technology is successfully developed it will not represent a magic bullet solution to drug problems nor is it likely that they will be appropriate for all people with drug problems
Should developments in this area progress successfully, controlled evaluations will be required to establish their safety and efficacy and individuals who receive these treatments should give free and informed consent to their use
A strong ethical argument exists that the safety and efficacy of these treatments should be well studied before the treatments are used under legal coercion
And that any such use should be separately evaluated before it is widely introduced
The same is true for the more speculative use of vaccines in children and adolescents to prevent drug use and hence addiction
It would appear wise to discourage the use of 126 Chapter 6: Conclusions and possible implications of advances in addiction neurobiology vaccines for this purpose until considerable clinical experience has been obtained with the use of vaccines in the treatment of addiction
Depot or sustained release pharmacological treatments Similar ethical requirements for drug vaccines are also raised by the potential use of drug implants
This leads to the same conclusion that the efficacy of these treatments should be evaluated in registered clinical trials before being used widely
If these prostheses were to be used under legal coercion, then sound arguments exist that they should be offered as a range of treatment choices, which includes other options of proven effectiveness
Neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation Neurosurgery treatment of addiction is an invasive, irreversible and risky form of treatment
It is hard to draw any other conclusion than this
Its use should be discouraged in preference to using less invasive and reversible forms of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments
While it is less invasive, similar recommendations would apply to deep brain stimulation
Transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive neurological treatment that appears to have limited adverse effects
Preliminary studies suggest that it may be effective in treating addiction (e.g
reducing impulsive or compulsive behaviours)
More research should be conducted into the safety and efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of addiction
Neuroimaging Neuroimaging methods are promising investigatory tools that have and will continue to illuminate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug use and addiction
Their use as screening methods for forensic, employment or other purposes is premature until the strengths and limitations of these methods are better understood
Drug testing Drug testing, when it is used, should be for the purposes of monitoring and improving treatment of the addicted individual or safeguarding the wider community
It is ethically unacceptable to use it as a form of extrajudicial punishment
The results of drug tests should remain private and confidential
Access to this information should be protected from third parties, including law enforcement, unless access has been granted by a formal legal process (e.g
court order, subpoena or other appropriate legal framework), or the individual gives fully informed and uncoerced consent
127 Addiction neurobiology: Ethical and social implications Treatment in prisons The principle of equivalence of care means that addicted prisoners should have access to drug treatment and harm minimisation measures that can help protect their health
The options available should generally mirror those available to the wider community
For opioiddependant individuals, this would in the EU generally include some form of substitution treatment
Prisoners should also have access to voluntary HIV and HCV testing and counselling
Both ethical and medical objections exist to forced unsupervised opioid detoxification
These are particularly strong for those who were stabilised on a maintenance treatment, prior to their incarceration
A general principle, again with both ethical and medical justification, is that similar privacy protections should apply for prisoners as to the rest of the population
Treatment during pregnancy Pregnant women should be engaged and positively encouraged to enter treatment and receive early antenatal care
Ethical objections exist to the forcible treatment for addiction of pregnant women and measures in this area can be counterproductive, may cause greater harm to the mother and child and may discourage pregnant women with drug problems from seeking help
There is, in many countries, a need for more investment in treatment programmes tailored towards the needs of drugdependent women

How do you do that and how do you ensure that you keep on succeeding in each one of your strategies? This book will introduce you to the world of social media to help you appreciate the importance of using various tips and strategies when marketing your business on different social media platforms
Thanks again for downloading this book, I hope you enjoy it! SOCIAL MEDIA ADAPT OR DIE Clone are the days when small businesses could not advertise their products to the masses because of cost restrictions, as large corporations that have huge marketing budgets scramble for all TV and radio ad space! So, what do you do to fully use social media to derive the most benefits? As a rule of thumb, don’t just get right into it without proper planning
You need to figure out how you are going to execute your plan in a manner that guarantees success
Here is what to do before you jump right into social media marketing and end up making some cosdy mistakes
But before we go there, what do you understand by the word “social media?” Well, much as it seems like an obvious word that you would know, you probably don’t have any specific definition of what it is
Nevertheless, it refers to applications and websites that make it possible for users to create and share different kinds of content or take active part in social networking
In simple terms, these are platforms that enable the user to participate in the communication process (at least you should know that the internet is nothing more than just an information database that we all try to access)
With social media, you can add comments, add videos, like or ‘participate’ in any other form
It includes social bookmarking, social news, wikis; social networking and social photo and video sharing just to mention a few
In this context, it is worthwhile to consider the history of social media and how we have adapted to it as a race
The emergence of social media The World Wide Web was developed circa 1991, and immediately attracted a community of people with like interests  this was a necessarily limited number, since few people possessed access to the internet, and fewer still the sophisticated skills required to connect to it
However, the rise of the personal computer and the graphic interface made using a computer much more simply and intuitive, giving rise to a new generation, which began taking the Internet much more seriously
Through this time, the Internet began becoming more and more important to businesses and families alike, allowing people to meet and bond over shared interests
The nucleus of a social network was formed with the idea of creating fan zones for popular media
This allowed fans of the same TV shows, games, or books to create a community around the media
These communities began to become stronger and more diverse as more and more people from around the world began to have access to the Internet
Blogs and websites are thus the oldest form of social media, which were formed with the intention of creating a space where likeminded individuals could engage with each other
The first major social network on this note was MySpace, which saw a huge swing in numbers from 20022004
However, issues with privacy led to the site closing down, losing a majority of its members, as it happens, to Facebook, which has consolidated that position into being the largest social network today
Twitter also emerged a few years later, and achieved first a niche in celebrity social media and then became a vibrant network on its merit
The success of Twitter opened up the possibilities for what could be done with the idea of social networking Pinterest focused on communities around shared interests, Snapchat on chatting through photographs, Instagram through a feed of photographs, and many others
Suddenly, social networking had become different from what it was when Facebook was consolidating its position  it had evolved to become the main reason why someone would use the Internet
Marketing was still slow to realize the potential of social media
Most brand pages were formed merely by fans, and while they were happy to advertise on Facebook, they did not consider the potential of being able to interact with their customers
It was only when Facebook revolutionized their Pages feature, making it much more streamlined for the benefit of brands that companies and brands began to take to Facebook in a big way
Today, social media marketing is one of the chief focus of any advertising agency
The number of people (constandy growing populations of adoptees) is too much to ignore
The question we have to ask when talking about social media, thus, is why people use social media
Undeniably, the reasons why people use social media have changed
From becoming a way to break sociocultural barriers over like interests, social media has begun to be appreciated for its own worth
Now, social media exists as a blueprint for the kind of a person someone is
Before meeting them, all you shall need is their name and you can know much more about them
Thus social media presence becomes a kind of footprint that you leave online
It informs almost every portion of our lives to such a high degree
Why do we need to think about this? The answer is that we cannot truly target audiences in this medium until we understand the medium
If we know the purpose for which our audience uses, say, Snapchat, we can best use the medium for our purposes
However, I hope another key point about social media has come to light
It has been a very personalized experience
It is very individual, while being focused on a community
This has meant a somewhat startling change for brands
Now, brands can speak direcdy to their audience, in real time
Customers may complain about the service, the products, or the brand itself
However, there will also be loyal customers who will stay with the brand
It is in this context that we frame the first critical question that we need to answer if we are to use social media for marketing purposes effectively: why are we using social media? We will answer this question in a short while
Let us return to the basics of marketing on social media
The journey building a strong social media brand entails having a strong positive presence in as many of these forms of social media as possible
Social media enables a brand to connect with its target group in an impactful and memorable manner  and along with its ability to provide exposure, and brand recognition, also remains an exciting and interesting media for the purpose of marketing
If you are still wondering why you should really embrace social media or die, here is why: Why go social? Increased brand recognition Think of different social media sites as a street intersection that attracts different numbers of people at different times and your presence in the different platforms as your billboard at that intersection
The more pronounced or outstanding your billboard is, the more the number of people who are going to notice who you are
Just like the billboard, having a strong social media presence will help boost your brand recognition since as we have seen, 1 in every four people uses social media
Social media provides an avenue for your brand to be seen and heard while making it easy for your current and prospective customers to find you
For instance, someone will know about your company by simply seeing a friend’s recent activity of liking your page
Additionally, your photos on Pinterest making them gain some interest in your business could wow someone
Your social media updates also help you rank highly in the search engines especially because they are indexed a lot faster
This in turn means more people can find you with a lot of ease
The more your brand becomes visible on social media and the more you engage your target audience, the more your business grows
Along with every post on social media being, essentially, premium ad space, the expanding horizons of social media as it grows in range from the more developed countries and areas to lesser developed regions means that it is an exciting opportunity to connect with a new emerging market in a meaningful way
Increased opportunities to convert Think of every new post you make on social media as a prime time ad
This simply means that you have an opportunity to sell (even if it isn’t hard/direct selling) to your audience, which in turn means that there will be some conversions
Unlike in a TV or radio ad where those who are not actively watching or listening don’t get to see your ad, the fact that the post is written or in picture format means that current, past and future followers/customers will have access to such content, which simply means that the conversions will be perpetual
With every post, video, comment or image, you are presenting an opportunity for your audience to react in the form of a visit to your website, email subscription, or purchase or any other form of conversion that you have set
Although every post won’t result to a positive conversion, the more you interact with your following, the more chances you have that someone will want to react
The fact that you are giving your audience an opportunity to react is enough to attract attention
The basic goal of social media marketing is to take one step further from conversion  from liking the brand, to loving the brand, and finally, to swearing by the brand
Social media can, with its advanced targeting methods, and improved connectivity, help you to find the precise kinds of customers to reach with your posts, and advertisements, and allow you to have direct conversations with them
You want your social media presence to helpful for your customers, but also provide some meaning to their lives and social mediums that can connect well with your brand
The result is exciting options creatively speaking which can help your brand become one that is loved and cherished by your customers
Reduced marketing costs Most small businesses cannot compete with large multinationals that have huge marketing budgets for advertising space on TV and radio
This means TV and radio advertising are out of the question for them as far as advertising is concerned
The internet and in particular the social media has made it a lot easier and less cosdy for small businesses to target their audience with great ease
What social media provides in this scenario is a similar kind of reach, a different kind of audience, and flexibility in terms of both frequency and advertisement costs
You could even reach out to over 10,000 highly targeted people with a budget of less than $20 if you are opting for paid advertising
This is a very tiny fraction of how much it would cost you to advertise on TV and radio
Nonetheless, if you don’t want to go this route, spending about 6 hours a week is enough to result to increased traffic; you can split this into one hour daily for 6 days
Enhanced customer insights You can easily listen to what people are saying about you, about themselves and about different issues that concern them that might be of interest to you
By following people’s comments, likes, shares and follows, you can easily tell what it is they really like
This can in turn help you make an informed decision with respect to the kind of content to share, when to share it and how to share it
You can then try different campaigns just to help you understand what works and what doesn’t
In fact, social media marketing campaigns can be goldmines of data, which can provide you an insight into the kind of products, advertisements, and brand identity that your target group prefers, and which find a better response from customers
Further, more sophisticated methods of statistical data collection can provide your brand with a welldeveloped idea of the kind of customers they have, their interests, and their desires
This gives a better idea to the brand in that they can make their products and other advertisement more appealing to their customers
Enhanced brand loyalty A research published by the Texas Tech University has proven that by engaging your current, past and prospective customers through social media, you are likely to enhance brand loyalty
This could be mainly because people want to be heard and answered whenever they have anything that they need answers on
Actually, another research published by Convince & Convert showed that over 50% of Americans actually follow the brands they are loyal to on social media! As you can clearly see, you have everything to gain when you engage your audience through social media
The critical difference between conventional and social media is that of voice
The voice of a brand refers to the manner in which it engages with its audiences  and the ideal voice depends both on the kind of brand it is, and the customers it hopes to attract
For example, a brand concerned with luxury clothing would ooze of high society speech, a focus on sophistication, and the feeling of luxury
In the same manner, a tshirt brand focusing on young adults would benefit more from an edgy, slighdy selfmocking voice that is cognizant of trending topics and media
Brand voice is important because it distinguishes a brand from its competitors
It allows the audience of a brand to associate the brand with the voice and build up the brand identity along these lines
The critical difference between social media and conventional media is in developing this kind of a voice, and thus, in building this kind of an identity
While in conventional media, owing to high costs and low audience reaction times, few risks can be taken, the flexibility in content and finances that social media provides allows the brand to experiment with different kinds of voices
It also becomes a very important form of intensifying the voice
For many customers and audiences, the social media presence of a brand can be the side of the brand that they are most exposed to  and so the right kind of content and style can help build this voice, and thus, the identity of the brand
Better customer experiences Engagement could be taken as interacting with your friend; as you well know, the more you interact with anyone, the more you get to know them and the closer you become
The inverse is true; if you don’t interact, you will grow apart! Social media is a communication tool that allows direct communication between you and your current and prospective customers
Unlike phones where you answer questions to individuals, with social media, you are interacting with your follower live, which simply means that other people could easily check out older threads if they are looking for something
The more you engage your customers, the greater their level of satisfaction, which as we all know is one of the top ingredients to nurturing customer loyalty
Social media can help you clear confusion and misunderstandings making it easier to keep customers happy
For instance, if a customer complains about your product or service on Facebook, it is easy to address that issue publicly either through offering an apology or explaining whatever issue is bringing confusion
It doesn’t have to be complaints; you can also appreciate a follower’s positive comments just to show that you really appreciate that feedback
Customer service also works on one key principle: the customer does not interact with the brand as if it were the brand, but as if it was a person  thus customer service on social media provides a unique opportunity to finetune the voice of the brand
Improved brand authority Have you noticed that people always tend to brag about their experiences on social media? When more people are talking about great experiences they have had when using your products or services, you definitely stand to gain if you have a good social media presence
Actually, as people talk about you, new users regard the brand highly
This ultimately results to more conversions and easier attainment of your company’s objectives
Tap SEO power If you have any experience in marketing a business online, I know you are aware of how hard it can be to appear in the top search results of the different search engines
Actually, updating a blog as often as possible, having excellent meta descriptions and having backlinks isn’t just enough to make you get a spot in the top searches for your targeted keywords
The truth is that search engines nowadays largely consider social media presence in determining the rankings of different sites
Therefore, the more presence you have on social media, the higher you are likely to rank in the search engines since you are considered trustworthy, legitimate, and credible
It is pretty simple, right! Greater inbound traffic Before using social media, the only people who will probably visit your website will be those who are already familiar with your brand and those who are currendy searching for the keywords that you rank highly (if you have any)
When you create a new social media profile, you are actually building a new avenue for people to visit your website and check out what you have on offer
This coupled with the fact that every post is an opportunity to attract interest means that you are actually increasing the number of ways through which people can see you, which ultimately results to increased conversions
With the coundess ways in which you stand to gain when you embrace social media, I know that you are definitely interested in getting started right away
Marketing on social media is slightly more difficult than just forming a page or a profile, and then just posting content
Since social media provides a flexible avenue for all kinds of marketing, a dedicated plan is a necessity to take the maximum advantage of the opportunities of social media
While social media will provide you a lot of leeway with any plan  a broad strategy in how to approach the medium can save you a lot of time, effort, and money
Getting Started Well, before you get started in social media branding, you need to do some form of preparation to be sure that you know where you are headed to; in any case, how can you tell where you are headed when you don’t have a plan? Answer the following questions to get started: • What is your objective for social media utilization? • Who is your target group? • What is your expectation out of that particular social media site? • What is the easiest way of attaining your objective? So, why do you need to answer these questions? Let’s understand how each of them relates to attaining your ultimate goal of succeeding in developing your social media brand
Setting objectives Your objectives for using social media could be such things like: • Developing awareness about your business • Engaging your target audience effectively and building customer loyalty • Increasing website traffic in a bid to increase leads • Increase the credibility of your business to become a thought leader • Increase conversions/revenue generation • Enhance operational efficiency Spur innovation through observing and sharing trends You need to know why you’re using social media for your brand
Depending on the kinds of objectives, which depend on a variety of factors such as your degree of proficiency and comfort with social media, the kind of brand you represent and the degree to which it can be incorporated in social media, and many more; you can choose the kind of plan, platform and posts that are uniquely suited to your brand, voice and identity
As a rule of thumb, ensure that your objectives or goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant/result focused, and Timebound)
Obviously, these need to be detailed enough to ensure that you don’t leave anything to chance
Let’s talk about this in greater detail: Specific Ensure everything is simple and clearly defined in order to eliminate fuzziness in all your goals
In simple terms, you get rid of all ambiguity when you make your goals specific
Don’t just say that you want to be more social or want to make more sales with social media; instead, you should specify what “more” means to you
Just to help you get started as you develop any social media goal you should ask yourself some very important questions: • What do you really want to achieve with your actions? • Who is really involved with the goal? • Where exacdy is your activity located? • Why do you really want to achieve the goals you have set? When do you want to start working towards the goal and when do you want to accomplish that? • What exacdy is needed to get the job done? Let me give you an example: By February 1 st , I want to have attracted 100 likes to my Facebook page by posting 23 times a day and responding to customer queries within 24 hours
Just to help you understand, this answers when the goal is to be achieved, specifies the goal (100 likes) and how to get it done
Measurable It is very simple to set broad goals which leave a lot to be defined
However, that is counter¬ productive to the good social media plan
It is far more worthwhile to outiine measurable, and incremental objectives that you can track and focus on
Your specific goals should have a measurable milestone such that you can tell how good or bad you are doing based on the set targets
For instance, you can measure your posts in terms of the number of people that specific post has reached
This simply means that the method of measuring performance in different social media sites is bound to be a lot different
For instance, you could think of such things like number of shares, number of retweets, likes, follows, reads etc
You can also measure it in terms of the number of people who actually purchased your product or service due to your social media activity
Here is an example just to make you understand what I am talking about: By April 1 st , I will have increased my content sharing, clicking and commenting by 10% to help us reach a larger audience
The example above is pretty straight forward and features specific measurement criteria of a 10% increase in comments, shares and clicks, which will be the indicators of an increased audience and engagement
Achievable We all know that any goal you set should be challenging such that it pushes you to move out of your comfort zone
However, it shouldn’t’ be unachievable or frustrating to achieve
As such, you should first evaluate your current skills level and resources before you can set the goals
Test your skills level before setting the goals just to be sure that you can actually achieve such goals
Relevant/result focused Your social media activity isn’t relevant to the platform alone
What is important is that you must measure goals and not your social media activities
For instance, you shouldn’t set goals such as sending 20 tweets daily
Instead, you should focus on what these actions are meant to achieve; this could be increasing awareness of your brand and many other subtie goals
Here is an example to help you understand what I am talking about: By May 1 st , I will develop a system that directly ties all social media activity to lead collection through giving a sign up reason for an exclusive newsletter where I will be delivering earlybird deals to customers
As you can notice from the above example, the result here is to achieve a 11 contact with customers
Time bound You don’t have until eternity to do what you have to do to achieve your social media goals
Your social media marketing goals should be properly timed to create a sense of urgency and tension that pushes you to achieve your goals
All the examples I have mentioned already had a date if you were keen to notice! If you have thought and deliberated about the objectives of your social media plan, you must also begin thinking more keenly about your brand  the kind of voice and the kind of identity, surely, but one of the most important avenues of thought in terms of social media is the target audience
Since social media can allow you to connect with your target audience with targeted ads and data analysis, marketing in social media requires a more nuanced understanding of the target audience, their needs, and desires
When you have everything thought out as far as goal setting/ setting of objectives is concerned, you also have to consider the target audience for your marketing efforts
The target audience group Determine the target audience for your social media marketing efforts; you simply cannot be targeting everyone! Unlike in TV and radio advertising where you might not have the options on who to target, social media has such options so you need to choose who you target
You can make a decision based on: • Age group • A particular community • Gender • A particular group that has interest on specific products • A global presence • A particular location • People who have certain preferences • Those using a certain social media platform A well thought out target audience can make seemingly large and important decisions become simpler to decide  such as choosing a social media platform
While it can seem like a very important decision considering the variety of different social media platforms and their differences, the most important factor in this decision is target audience  since they are the ones you need to reach
If your target audience is young adults, who are interested in arts and photography, and their preferred platform is Pinterest, you would not want to use, for example, twitter
A keen understanding of the target audience is important also for good content, since only if you know their needs and desires will you know the kind of content that will provide value to their lives
It will become very easy to choose any social media platform if you setde on the target audience
The next step is to map your expectations from whatever social media site you will settie on
In any case, any SMART goal should be Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time bound
What is your expectation from using any social media platform? As you list your expectations, you should ensure that you are very specific about what you want
That is the only way you can tell whether you are actually attaining your objectives or not
Different social media platforms also have different conversion rates so you have to understand that beforehand so that you can know what to expect from your marketing efforts
Here are some things to answer before you can continue: • What level of performance do you want to attain? • How easy is it to attain that level of performance? • What will you need to attain that level of performance? • How many people do you want to attract in the process? • Will you be able to measure your audience vs
increase in sales with precision? Once you map out your expectations, the next thing you need to do is to determine the best strategies to use to attain your objectives and expectations with ease
What is the easiest way of attaining your objective? Every social media site has its “hacks” that the pros have already mastered so that you can attain faster results
You need to understand what is needed for you to attain that
Do you need to pay anything in the process or is it something you can do on your own? Do you have to get any technical expertise for you to attain your objectives with greater ease? When you answer these pertinent questions, you will be well on your way to developing a strong social media brand
Remember, however, that organic growth with good content and quick customer response time is the best recipe for success in social media
After deciding on that, the next step is to start evaluating the different social media platforms so that you can tell how they will be of importance to you in developing a social media brand
You will discover that you might probably need many of the social media sites/applications discussed in the next segment once you read how to use them and the benefits you can get from using such applications
We will look at each individually and in detail to help you understand how to develop a social media brand in that site/application/platform so that you can unleash the full power of that particular platform
Obviously social media can be categorized depending on a number of factors
Perhaps the best way of categorizing is on the degree of maneuverability and flexibility you are allowed in kinds of content
So you can choose between websites and blogs which give you every freedom to post, integrated social media websites which have a broad set of guidelines such as Twitter and Facebook and more secure websites of the latter kind which have many more restrictions on the kind of content and strategies you use
However, the benefits of having a blog in that context is balanced by the number of existing audiences that sites like Twitter and Facebook can give you  Facebook has a growing population of more than 2.1 billion people, and Twitter is a constandy expanding social media platform as well
The number of dedicated followers means that the integrated social media platform have much value to add to your social media strategy
Because each social media platform and blog provides different kinds of target audiences, value additions and other quirks, a plan for each social media platform is a good idea
TIPS ON HOW TO DOMINATE FACEBOOK Facebook boasts of over 1 billion active monthly users spread across the globe making it by far the most popular social media site across all age groups and societies
Facebook also attracts over 4.5 billion likes daily, 665 million active users daily, and over 765 million mobile monthly users
With this huge user base, it means that you can take advantage of the platform to promote your business to Facebook’s users
Going back to our billboard analogy, Facebook is the busy intersection where over 1 billion people pass through so having some presence there will mean that you can attract a fraction of this insanely huge number
Just to give you some inspiration on why using Facebook is critical, let me give you some reasons why: Why use Facebook? In addition to the social media marketing benefits we’ve already talked about, these are pretty much unique to Facebook
The numbers As I already mentioned, Facebook is by far the biggest social media site based on the number of users
In Facebook, the secret is to get as many people as possible to see your posts or your brand, like it, follow, share or whatever action they have to take
The good thing about Facebook is that it is used virtually everywhere around the world so you can be certain that there will be millions of people in whichever location you are in
The fact that an average Facebook user spends about 21 minutes daily means that being on Facebook and sharing your content gives you an opportunity to engage with as many people as possible
Well, here is an interesting fact that will give you greater motivation
An average Facebook user has about 130 friends
This simply means that when you share anything that people share, you are creating a ripple effect when several people share that
Your posts could easily go viral if they can generate many shares because whenever anyone shares anything, such people are subtly promoting you
As such, the key to success is ensuring that your posts capture the attention of the first group of people who encounter that content so that you can stimulate response
Cross promotion Facebook is constantly updating its algorithm such that people see less of irrelevant content on their feeds
One way of ensuring that you get people to see your posts is to have a Facebook Fan page for your business
This Facebook page acts like some sort of mini website for your business
Although this doesn’t automatically mean that the numbers will jump from one hundred to tens of thousands of users, you can be sure that the more you keep promoting the business, the more it grows and the more it promotes your website or brick and mortar store
We will talk about how to move from few likes to thousands or tens of thousands of likes later in the book
Future proof As I already mentioned, Facebook is always updating its search algorithm
For instance, recendy, Facebook banned the use of like gating as a method of attracting likes (we will discuss this later)
Paying for advertising seems to be a norm today unlike in the past where it was easier to promote a business without paying a cent
Although this (paid advertising) is fairly easy and affordable, it is better to use the method now and not later because as more businesses adopt this model, the competition becomes higher, which means that the effectiveness of such ads will probably be lowered
As such, it is better to adapt whatever strategy you use to get likes now and not later! Facebook will definitely not strip you off your likes if you obtained them legitimately even if it updates its search algorithm to make it harder to attract new likes
So, when you have more likes, you are sort of shielded from any changes that might make it harder for you to succeed in future
This also means that you have to invest in providing value to your current audience if you really want to keep them checking your page
Targeting Unlike in Google and other search engines where you can only target someone based on his or her search preferences, Facebook allows you to target your audience (if you use paid search) with great precision
For instance, you can target audience in terms of gender, age, location, apps, mobile device use, education, life events, interests, travel, likes and purchase behavior with utmost precision, which simply means that there will be a high conversion rate
This is simply because Facebook users unknowingly or knowingly build a very comprehensive profile about themselves making it a lot easier to target them with pinpoint precision
No other platform, online or offline provides such targeting precision
If you are using paid advertising on Facebook, you could easily target audience that has similar characteristics as your existing audience, which simply means that the conversions will definitely be higher if your existing audience has had good success
You could for instance target lookalike websites, lookalike pages, lookalike mobile app users, and lots of other lookalikes! This ultimately means greater marketing ease and ease of audience expansion
I know you know the limitiess potential that Facebook provides to your business but what has been preventing you from taking advantage of Facebook to market your business fully is lack of knowledge on how to do it right
In simple terms, you are asking, “How can I effectively market by business or increase my brand visibility through Facebook?” Here is how: As we know, Facebook is not only used for chatting; it allows you to upload photos, videos, share the links, share the feelings, and share the interests just to mention a few
If I am a customer interested in buying a particular product that your business is selling, I will probably first check what others are saying about the product or your business
I will then go on to check reviews, ratings and anything else that would help me make an informed decision on the subject matter
In that case, if you create a centralized hub for your business in Facebook, don’t you think people will find it easier to access all that information in just one place? You can even be answering all questions or concerns that your target audience might have to make it easier for others to make decisions in future
In simple terms, you might not need to be answering the same questions over and over again when you have a central page on Facebook since people can always read responses relating to various issues that others have had
Facebook Page To get started, simply create a Business Facebook Fan page for your business then invite your friends to like your page, join groups that have interests in your products or business, post all your offers in that page and make your customers to visit that page
Well, since it isn’t as obvious as it sounds, let me take you through the business page creation process: Step one: Visit this page to create a new page (Please note that you can only create a page when you are already a Facebook user so if you don’t have an account, please create one
You can use your personal account if you want this account to act as the admin account for that page)
@ Jfcs # A Create a Page H CiMKtPege loc* feamt« fttc* lOC4l Bu*inr«» or Pta* 0»MM «tfH 4 >OCM > v ATK’Cn “v«p | fi**4 **«■<• jnc«i l» Im* tei Sam Xo C'trcM' Da jl 1 *—_ >C#* JOOV ii k l'***! r>
to *K#Ooo* : >^i “r~% EiA >«(« V The process is pretty straightforward
However, here are some things to note that will make the difference between a killer page and one that is not: #Fill all the fields Make sure you fill everything that needs to be filled including your contact, website (if any), page description, etc
The page description also helps in organic search and Facebook’s search so ensure that you use some descriptive keywords just to make it easier for people to find you
However, don’t stuff the keywords! #Categorize your business wisely This will make it a lot easier for people to search it, which means categorizing your business in the right category can make the difference between being found and being confused with another business
For instance, if you run a bar, don’t categorize your business as concert/venue unless you are promoting concert and venues in your bar
Also, don’t say it is a food grocery if you are running a plumbing company! #Customize your page URL You don’t want an unprofessional page URL
At best, you should ensure that your URL has the exact name of your page (this helps in organic search in search engines)
For instance, if your page is named Michael Roberts, your URL should be something like facebook.com/michaelroberts
Please note that you can only change your unique address once
Also, you cannot change the Page name when you hit 100 fans
#Profile photo The profile picture should speak volumes about your business; you shouldn’t just choose anything that comes (It is even advisable to have your company logo)
#Should you start inviting people right away? I wouldn’t recommend that you start inviting people or advertising your page if you don’t have anything on your page yet
Your first priority should be to start posting stuff that people would want to check around when they visit your page
Think about it; would you want to like a page that has no photos, updates, likes etc? If you hardly like pages that have nothing to like, don’t push people to like your page when it has nothing
Asking people to like a blank page will be a wasted opportunity to sell yourself better
#So, should you like your page immediately? Much as you might think that it doesn’t hurt to like your page as the first person, I would advise against it
Since liking your page will appear in your timeline, you don’t want people to see that you are liking pages that don’t have content yet; you want to reserve that for the time you will have populated your page or when you think you have had enough posts to make people to want to share, like etc
In simple terms, liking your page as the first person will be wasting potential traffic, which you should have gotten had you opted to wait until you have populated your page with great content
#When to invite your friends If you have guests that you are inviting over to your house, would you want them to find that the house is not in order? Well, if you don’t want to be embarrassed by the emptiness in your house, have stuff filled in it; it could be decorative art that captures their attention or furniture! Similarly, your Facebook page needs to have content before you can invite friends to check out what you have been up to! #Should you pay for ads yet? Well, much as it might be tempting to boost your posts through paying for ads on Facebook, don’t just jump right into it
Instead, you should ensure that you have enough content to keep any lead you generate through paying busy and interested in what you have to offer
You might think that doing just that will guarantee that you will get the maximum exposure needed for you to have a strong social media brand
This is not the case
You need more than that to succeed; after all, so many others do just that but end up giving up because they don’t attain their goals
Do you know why? The reason for all this is pretty simple; they don’t get to attract their target audience
Just as in the search engines where SEO is critical for success, you need to use some strategies to succeed in attracting the audience you want
So, how do you attract more likes to your page? 1
Share a link to your Facebook page on the groups that you joinsome members of these groups could probably like your page in the process
2
Add a like us button on your website and share it constantiy in your social circles
3
Invite your business contacts to visit and like your page
4
Ensure that you have a clear and fresh call to action on your landing pagedon’t be afraid to ask people to like your Facebook page! You should even set up a landing tab: Before announcing your page publicly, you should probably set this one up; this gives you control to get people to respond to your call to action
Although like gating is not allowed (Facebook stopped this in November 2014), you can use this landing page to increase conversions as opposed to having new people landing on your wall
You just need to set up an effective call to action that will prompt a new visitor to like your page
Even if you don’t set up any application, you can pin a post, which has the call to action 5
Use high quality and fascinating images and content to attract people to share your content and even prompt more likes
Actually, you will realize that the more visual you are in your content, the greater the number of likes
Don’t be afraid to post video tutorials or share relevant videos on your page to help your audience in various ways
You can also think of sharing photos of people enjoying your services just to give your business a sense of humanity
6
Always strive towards telling people what they would want to know about the business or industry; do your research
This means having some information relating to the stuff that happens behind the scenes
7
Ensure that your email signature has a link to your Facebook fan page
8
Tag the fan page so that it can appear on your friends news feed
Use the tag @fanpage or #fanpage when referring to your Facebook page
This comes in handy when you have a personal account that already has your friends on it
You could also ask your friends, employees and other groups admins for help on that
9
Master how to target fans based on their interests, demographics and location
10
Leverage the existing traffic on your website for greater likes and social media publicity
Place the social media icons near the homepage to maximize click through rate (CTR)
11
Set a specific time when you post and maintain consistency in posting
12
Use Facebook groups for greater engagementYou can create open, closed or secret groups depending on the nature of discussions that go in this page
We will talk about the power of Facebook groups shordy just to help you realize how much you stand to gain
13
When everything fails, use paid advertising on Facebook to reach out to your target audience
Well, using paid advertising doesn’t mean that you have not had success in what you are doing
This can fast track the entire process thus ensuring that you get more likes within a shorter period without much struggle
Let me discuss this a little further
The power of a Facebook Ad A recent survey found that most of the online advertisements are reaching only 27% of their intended audiences
However, the same survey is explaining that an advertisement in Facebook is making 90% reach to its intended audiences
So now you have the understanding about the power of a Facebook advertisement, right? How do you get started? Though it is easy to think that an ad will result to automatic increase in likes, the real picture is not exacdy the same
You need to ensure that you target your ad to the right audience to maximize your conversion rate
Since Facebook paid ads cost money, you don’t want to be wasting your advertising credits readvertising to the same people especially those who have already converted to paid customers
As such, you should master the power of remarketing on Facebook
Let me explain that
So, what is remarketing? In its simplest terms, remarketing is simply a tactic that helps you to advertise to individuals who have shown interest in your product or service after visiting your website
In this case, you segment the website visitors through creating custom ads for such groups of people
In this case, only such people get to see such ads on Facebook
In essence, remarketing on Facebook enables you to increase conversions while ensuring that you keep your cost of customer acquisition as low as possible
One of the greatest benefits of this technique is that it only shows ads to those who are genuinely interested in whatever you are selling
For instance, you can remarket to those who already visited your website but did not buy anything or those who have already completed an initial sale
Another target audience for your ad could be those who don’t know about your product but are already interested in something similar
Since there are both organic and paid visitors, you need to ensure that you differentiate paid and organic traffic
So, how do you stand to gain if you start remarketing? Reduced cost per click Remarketing on Facebook results to reduced cost per click (much lower than on search engines) especially because Facebook traffic is usually supposed to be far less targeted than any search engine traffic
In essence, people on search engines are already searching for a certain product or service, which means that they are asking for your service
On the other hand, social media traffic is not as targeted because people are not actively looking for whatever you are selling
In the search engines, users are usually searching for a particular product, which means they are asking for your product (pull marketing) but in social media, the users are not really searching for anything and may not even convert to paying customers (push marketing)
This in turn makes Facebook ads a lot lower than ads on search engine since technically speaking; users on Facebook are not really searching for your product or service at the moment
Here is a picture showing how to hyper target your audience
Create Audi«nc« CwMom CoraCMrwiOon w Aimw «ho ymtt your i <mn l*du 0 »O P«OC** W*1 KWOfiC MO CWO« P*oc** vnttng ic«Q>*c mo papal but no( ottwi PoocM «^k> Njvan t v*vt«d m a oartan amount of t*n* ✓ Cutfom ConrtNrvfeon inOMiMio 30 iirt o r wfi With this model, you can easily target people who have visited your site but have not converted yet, which means that you are ultimately keeping your cost per click costs low while maximizing customer acquisition
To go about this, you will need to have consistent quality marketing, which entails customizing the message such that it includes some additional information to what such customers are already aware of about your product since their last visit to your website
With that, you can expect to see increased CTR (click through rate) than other marketing campaigns while ensuring that you keep customer acquisition costs low than first time visitor conversion costs
You are also likely to have a lot better engagement
#Improve conversion rate If you have ever marketed anything, you can be certain that converting first time website visitors into paying customers is not easy and takes time
Actually, if your industry is highly competitive, such visitors are likely to be checking out multiple sites before they can even make a purchase
The truth is that they will compare several sites before they can make the purchase so if they leave your site, some will probably have a problem finding your site in future even if they are interested
As such, you risk losing sales if such people don’t finally find their way back
Others could probably have converted had they gotten some motivation from your end
Remarketing comes in handy in such circumstances because when such visitors see your ad especially if it features some more info that they probably didn’t know, they are likely to convert to paying customers
•nd With remarketing technique, you can even opt to exclude those who have already made a sale through creating a custom remarketing segment for those who have already visited your thankyou page; in this case, you can prevent them from seeing that campaign
#With remarketing, you can capitalize on social proof As you go on with your marketing efforts, try not to be too limited by the fact that you are only targeting ‘qualified’ customers
You can show your ads to a wider audience such as those who already bought products or services from you just to ensure that you let the two groups of people interact
You will be amazed by the fact that happy customers will be highly willing to post something encouraging that will make those on the fence want to buy from you
Actually, when someone sees that others have already purchased your product or service, they are likely to feel more comfortable buying from you, which means that they are likely to convert to paying customers
By doing this, you are also enhancing your brand loyalty; you want more loyal customers than just new customers because loyal customers will buy from you with little or no marketing effort i.e
near zero cost of acquisition
One interesting thing about loyalty is that if you extend your audience to start including your current customers, it is a lot easier to upsell while ensuring that you are more social and more engaging
This is mainly because when any customer sees you on any social media platform, they will probably engage you resulting to more conversions
With that, you will have a larger audience so that you can start attaining your goals
So, what impact should you expect from your efforts? The Facebook Impact Now you have created the page and have implemented the strategies for increasing likes that I mentioned above
What should you expect after that? How do you stand to gain from your marketing efforts? 1
When you frequently post offers of your products in the Facebook page, it will make more visitors and more hits to your page
This will drastically increase your web traffic
2
When you engage your fans on your Facebook page, they will have better experience, which means that they will probably respond positively about your business
This in turn attracts more likes/fans since people want to associate with good businesses that give customers excellent experiences
The more positive comments and reviews you get, the more business will come your way
Once you start receiving positive reviews from the customers through email, you can publish such reviews in your Facebook page in order to attract many more customers, which will generate more leads for you
3
When you do post sales or post service followup, it will increase the number of repeat customers; you will also get referrals through word of mouth
Every business that is on Facebook and is serious about its social media activities can probably pay for likes, and figure out ways of getting people to like its page
However, some businesses are simply exceptional in the way they do their stuff; they don’t just do the minimum! Since each business has its unique strengths as far as social media is concerned, you would probably want to spy on your competition just to be aware of what is happening
Here are some creative ways of spying on your competition on Facebook
1
Make use of Facebook Pages to watch Your biggest strength here is the fact that very few businesses are using this feature and the fact that the competitor can never know that you are spying
Instead, they get a message that someone has placed them on the watch list (without specifying who)
So, how do you start using this feature? When you login to your Facebook page, navigate to the overview section located on the Facebook insights tab then scroll down to add page then select this option (although there is an option for you, you can simply search a specific page to add)
You can then add all the pages that you would want to watch (you have up to 100 pages to add)
Ensure that you add a few pages from industry leaders within your niche just to make sure that you are getting insights on what works for them and what doesn’t
You could also know which kinds of posts are popular
To check out how a page you are watching is performing, you simply need to click on the page’s name to get all the data
Go to the section for posts (in the insights page) and then click the option for top posts from all pages that you are following (you will get 5 popular posts from all the pages in your watch list)
You can get more info about the posts by clicking on each post just to know the type of engagement in each post (likes, shares, comments etc)
2
Use vital photos from post planner This is a premium service that goes for about $29 a month and helps you get to know such things like all time popular photos
To get info about any page, you simply need to add its URL to the app
So, how can you use that to your benefit? Simple; you can share it on your page to help drive more likes and comments
Just make sure that it doesn’t promote the competitor’s business (such things like watermarks or copyrighted images are a no no)! 3
Facebook interest list This is another excellent way of tracking your competition without them knowing
You can add a page to your interest list even if you haven’t liked its page
So, how do you set this up? Locate the interest option on the left side bar of your page’s home page then click add interest
You can then move on to create a list then proceed to search for the page(s) that you want to track/monitor then click next
You will then be given an option to provide a name for your list
I should point out that you should set your privacy setting to ‘only me’ just to ensure that no one else can access it
If you don’t mind having the list public, just provide a very descriptive name for your list
You can then click done
Once you are done, you can always visit the interest section to check the most popular and most recent posts
Through that, you can be more confident on the kind of posts that spur conversation and action
Actually, you can even track your competitor’s actions without visiting their page! 4
Use Simply Measured to get free reports Simply Measured provides free social media reports for literally all social media platforms including Vine, Twitter, Facebook Google+, Linkedln etc
All you have to do is share your experience with Simply Measured on any social media site
With this platform, you can actually compare 2 weeks reports against your competition
You could also opt to upgrade to the paid service
The downside of this service is that you can only know whether a post is promoted or not by visiting that page, which can be tedious to follow up! Knowing what your competition is doing and knowing how to attract likes to your page is a very good thing
However, this might not really cut it when you want to be outstanding
Here are some actionable tips on how to customize your Facebook page to make it a “like magnet”
Tips for greater success on Facebook as far as branding is concerned #Join as many groups as possible and share links to your page as often as possible
You could even post in the name of the Fan page
If done well i.e
images and captivating content, you could easily make people to click on your page and like the page
This in turn increases traffic to your Fan page
#Be activeJoining the groups isn’t enough; you need to post as often as possible (don’t spam though)
The more people see links to your site, the more they will be inclined to check it out
#Organize events Organize events and invite your friends or members of the groups that you have joined
You could hold events in various groups or on your Facebook page
Also, attend other people’s events and post comments about various issues discussed in such groups
You could combine this with doing surveys on various issues relating to your business
#Piggyback on some hot topicsAfter Gregory Levey wrote the book tided “shut up I’m talking’, his Facebook group has grown from the initial 700 people who had purchased his book to over 6million likes
Try to use catchy headlines and even go on to reference hotbutton issues in order to capture the attention of the masses
Actually, the more people like your page, the more people actually continue liking and the viral effect will be highly likely
#Your Posts Posts that have between 100250 characters have been proven to attract up to 60% more likes, shares, and comments than those outside this limit
Be observant on your post length, just to help you analyze how you can actually derive more value from your Facebook posts
You should probably experiment with different post lengths just to help you determine your ideal post length
Trust me; those seemingly minute things that you would probably overlook actually count
Your posts should be short, engaging and shareable
#Start using link posts in order to drive people to your site Facebook now shows a clickable thumbnail when you add a link to a website making it a lot easier to attract people to your site
All you have to do is to enter your site’s URL then press enter
By doing that, the tide of the page, plus description and image in that URL will be visible (you can also choose to customize the text or image if you want)
Tip: Ensure that the image that displays is catchy to make people want to click on it
#Converse with your audience You should tiy asking your audience to share their thoughts or feedback with respect to your products and services
Through that, you can easily get to know what customers are looking for and ways through which you can enhance your business
Once this is done, you should then go on to post content that shows that you really took whatever feedback or suggestions they had into consideration
This should in turn build a stiong and loyal customer base because they know that you value their ideas
#Be the discount/pro motions business Everyone loves free stuff
Offering special deals or perks to your Facebook fans is a great way to keep them visiting your page and website just to hunt for free stuff
This will in turn drive more sales and tiaffic
Ensure that you have clear call to actions that have links to the most relevant page
Some interesting ways of enhancing engagement include having clear calls to action and even some redemption details
Also, don’t forget to let your audience know about when the promotion ends just to help you create a sense of urgency
You can blend the discounts and promotions with provision of exclusive information to your fans
You will be amazed by the manner in which this gets people to keep on checking your page just to know what is happening
This is a very handy method of driving loyalty and sales because you make your fans to feel treasured/valued because of having exclusive access to events, contests and news just to mention a few
#Strive towards being timely I wouldn’t want to visit a page that still has last year’s cyber Monday offers appearing as its recent posts when it is Easter the year after
As such, you should ensure that you have posts that depict what is happening at the moment
If it is Valentine’s Day, your posts should probably be tailored towards resonating with whatever is happening at the moment
You should also be timely in your responses; you wouldn’t want to be texting a friend who replies to your message five days later! In essence, you will notice that the faster you respond, the more your fans will engage you and the move visits you will have to your page
Tip: Try posting sneak peeks of some upcoming product sales some 1 or 2 weeks before major holidays like Cyber Monday, Black Friday, Christmas, New Year, Easter, and Valentines etc
You will be amazed by how you will keep your fans “glued” to your page! #Develop a posting calendar Although it is sometimes good to go with the flow, planning has a profound effect on your success rate in everything you do
Try to have a calendar showing what you want to be talking about (posting) in each week or month
Through that, you can have enough time to research on what you want to post (don’t just post aimlessly)
You should also try to find a frequency that works for you
In essence, you should try implementing any strategy you embrace for at least a month before you can switch to another strategy if that doesn’t work
#Master how to schedule your posts I already mentioned the importance of having a consistent posting schedule
What I didn’t tell you is that Facebook now allows you to use a scheduling feature just to make sure that your posts go live at specific times
This will help you cover up for times when you might be busy with something else making it hard for you to post
So, instead of failing to post when your audience is expecting your posts, you can schedule posts by clicking the clock icon located at the lower left hand corner of the page’s sharing tool
Tip: Ensure that you schedule your posts when a large number of your fans are online just to be sure that you will have greater engagement
You can know stats about that when you visit your page insights (within the posts tab)
To manage all your scheduled posts, you simply need to head to the top of your page then choose edit page before choosing Use Activity Log

VMl PoMl yiwng OJO 01 oaoit .01 It 3011 PoptLlWtf 73 14 3.741 !.«<} 1*2 • IU%' 4 4 This post shows some advanced page customization techniques that you would probably find effective in making your site to stand out
I had mentioned about groups in passing a while ago
Since this is a very critical part of establishing a solid foundation in Facebook, let’s discuss it in greater detail
Unleash the power of Facebook groups If you want to develop stronger ties with your customers, a Facebook group does the trick in helping you develop and nurture strong ties
As such, you could create a Facebook group for fans to discuss literally anything
Let me explain this by giving real benefits of how this works
#Use the group to get real customer feedback Having a Facebook group allows you to engage with your members with greater ease especially because group updates will be visible on recent activities of different members
Since your fans cannot receive notifications about what is happening in the Fan page, a workaround for that is to have a Facebook group
This in turn enables you to talk direcdy to people who are really interested in the subject matter (including those who need help)
Groups also provide easier engagement among members through responding to questions that members might have
Members can also post images about themselves using whatever products or services you have on sale, which in turn allows those who are still deciding to have a better idea of what to expect
This high level of interaction enhances the truth factor between the business, customers and members, which in turn makes it easier to know what such people are interested in
#Use a group to offer support There will be times that customers will need help or motivation
Instead of cluttering your page with discussions (well, a page doesn’t display the recent posts as a group does), you can support anyone who is in need through the group
Whether you are using an open, invite only or public group, you can be sure that a group makes it easier for some of the knowledgeable group members to assist those who need help
This in turn helps build confidence in members
Even with a large group, it is very easy to have nonaffiliated group admins to help steer conversations in the right direction
#A Facebook group can help you to spot new opportunities If you have a vibrant Facebook group, members will often come up with lots of ideas some of which could be very easy to implement
Even if you won’t be the one to implement that idea, you will definitely find it a lot easier to sell that idea to an interested party
#A group helps you to generate qualified leads Members of your group have a certain interest
This makes it easier to sell anything to them with lithe effort while ensuring that you keep your customer acquisition costs low
Your audience (qualified leads) is equal to the number of members in your group so the more members you have, the higher the number of leads
Before we can conclude on how to dominate Facebook, I should perhaps remind you that the more visual you are in your postings, the higher the likelihood that you will attain success
Here are some ingenuous ways through which you can become more visual in your Facebook marketing efforts
#Convert your ideas into images Humans are highly visual beings; we simply cannot help it but be glued to amazing images
So if you can compile everything you are thinking in some sort of image, you can easily capture the attention of your audience
This can be done through creating graphics, slideshows, images, infographics, and animations that you can use to animate and even teach your audience
The high level of engagement will amaze you when you use captivating images that prompt your audience to be interested
You will hardly need to tell them to share or like because they will do so without thinking! #Tell your story It is easy to digest information contained in an image than when it is contained in a long post
So, instead of wasting too much time writing a highly detailed story about yourself or your business, you could simply convert it to an image (some sort of a flow chart) that tells your story in a glance
Tip: Blend images with words to increase conversions
It might be challenging for some people to understand your photo so having some words in there can help make the image clearer
You can do so with captions, photo descriptions and adding some hashtags and keywords to make such photos more descriptive
Keep in mind that you can always hire a designer to create captivating photos to rocket fuel your campaign
Facebook has over 1.1 billion mobile users per month and over 700 million daily users
As such, you cannot overlook mobile marketing if you really are to dominate your niche on Facebook
You need to realize that content, audience and device are not a one size fits all sort of thing; each requires a unique engagement approach if you are to dominate
So, how can you go about that? Here are some mobile marketing tips that will help you become better at it
#Make sure that you know how your posts look like on mobile You don’t want annoy your audience by posting content that makes them have a hard time accessing
The first thing you should do is to be sure about how each post would appear if viewed on mobile
Your posts should be designed with a mobile user in mind
Such things like Facebook tabs can make your users to have an amazing or annoying experience when viewing your posts
Oneway of making your tabs easier to access is to custom make them using different tab creation tools
#A mobile friendly blog does the trick Even as you promote a website on Facebook, you cannot afford to have a site that is not mobile friendly
This is especially because a large number of mobile users will often click away if a page seems to be taking longer than usual to load
So, if you want to maximize your conversions, ensure that your blog or site loads easily on mobile
#Geo target your audience The fact that smartphones support GPS means that you can easily target specific groups of customers within a certain location to increase conversions
This is especially helpful in instances where you are promoting a brick and mortar business or a local event
You can combine these with click to call extensions on Google to make it a lot easier to convert such leads to paying customers
#Listen constantly Since your audience will definitely engage you even when you are out of your work desk, you also need to engage them constandy
You can use social monitoring apps like Mention since these often make it easy to filter sources hence making it a lot easier to engage your audience without wasting too much time
#DoiTt be afraid to share photos The good thing about social media is that it allows brands to “humanize” themselves such that the audience even forgets that they are interacting with a company; it becomes more of a personal relationship
To make your relationship even juicier, you should probably try posting photos of your business being social
These random photos really connect with your audience by capturing those “human” moments
We will later on talk about popular mistakes that people make that make it difficult to achieve dominance status that they are always looking for; you cannot dominate any social media platform if you are constandy making some ‘sillyVinnocent mistakes! HOW TO USE BLOGGING TO DOMINATE Wha, do you think of when you hear the word blogging? Well, I see blogs as information resources that enable people to make various decisions on different issues
Well, not all blogs help in decision making per se since some of them simply exist for entertainment purposes; some people want to follow the latest gossip on various people
A blog is essentially a personal kind of website in which you can add content of any kind you see fit
Because of this, a blog stretches to fit any kind of interest  however, the chief interest of a blog should probably be the spreading of information
For example, a blog is a popular platform for creative writers and artists since it enables them to keep all of their artworks and writings under one banner
A blog acts as a miniwebsite that interested audiences can use to know more about your brand
Thus, the kind of audiences you reach on your blog  they are already ones who are interested in your product, your brand and your content
Unlike with Facebook, Twitter or other integrated social media platforms, when blogging, you must focus almost exclusively on good, informative and entertaining content
Before you buy any new product, you will probably search it on various search engines; the search words could be anything such as, ABC safety, ABC side effects, ABC reviews, ABC benefits, etc
From the search results, we look for such things like comments, pricing, reviews, and experiences of others with respect to that product or service
Blogs can become the comprehensive space in which your audience can know all about your brand
We won’t go too much into detail on what a blog is and what it is not because you probably know a bit about blogging, WordPress, Blogger etc; instead, we will concentrate on how to use blogs to build a strong social media brand
Here are some dps on how to guarantee success through blogging
Know how to set up a blog Before you can even start attracting visitors to your blog and making them click around your blog, you should probably ensure that you have set the blog properly
Whether you are using WordPress or Blogger, you should at least have some basic understanding of how to set up your blog
In essence, your blog should give users a good experience
Here, having some degree of comfort with HTML and JavaScript coding can enable you to provide a more personalized experience with your blog
Further, platforms such as WordPress, Blogger, and Tumblr offer various kinds of themes that can further allow your blog to look distinctive
However, focus on keeping your blog clean
Just making it look striking does not mean it should be a clutter
It should be simple for your audience to use and access all the features of the blog
Optimize your blog for mobile Since blogs can have a lot of information in text and images, they can take a while to load, especially on mobile
With the growing use of smartphones, more and more people are using such devices to access information online
So whether you are promoting your blog on social media or are simply relying on the search engines to drive traffic, you should ensure that whoever visits your blog from a mobile device has a great experience
Navigation should not be a problem
Additionally, the pages should load pretty fast
If you don’t want to lose mobile customers because of a bad experience (slow loading speed or difficulty in navigation), you should probably hire someone to optimize your site for mobile view
The trend of social media is that more and more people are going to access the Internet on their phones, and therefore it is important to have an optimized, durable, and entertaining social media presence for people on phones everywhere
Get a premium domain The blog could be part of your website for easier navigation
But ensure that it doesn’t go anything like yourblog.wordpress.com or yourblog.blogspot.com
Instead, it should go like yourblog.com
Doing this costs a lithe bit of money, but lends a sense of exclusivity and panache to your blog
What do you want? Determine your objectives while ensuring that you put into consideration the way you want others to see your business
How would you want people to think about you? How can you implement that in your blog? This will help you in working around the content you publish on the blog for greater success
This is because content is the main kind of driver for your blog, unlike in Facebook where the focus is on conversations with your audience
Content is the only way in which you can address your target audience, and thus it is necessary for a clear vision of what you want from your blog
The underlying focus of a blog must be to increase engagement and awareness of the brand
Consistency pays Be consistent in your posting
Your audience needs to feel that they can count on your predictability
A blog that has recent posts from two years in the past is not an attractive destination for potential audiences
You’ll be able to attract the attention of audiences with a frequent schedule of posts  and with a plan on seeking what the audience wants, finding content to post will not be a problem
As you do this, keep in mind that projects and products can come and go but your brand will remain indefinitely; your blog should be timeless
Watch out what you post online Whatever you put there sticks there forever
Therefore, don’t put anything that could jeopardize your brand image
The Internet has a long memory, and nothing really can get deleted
Be conscious that everything you posts can probably be scoured up by someone at any time in the future, and post accordingly
Create sharable content For every post, ensure that you have a picture to it then share that on Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, Google+, Instagram and other social networks that you could be in
You will be amazed by the limidess power of Pinterest in driving sales and conversions
People are often attracted by images; the more captivating your picture is, the more it will be shared, the more pins it will get and the more repins it gets
In simple terms, captivating photos have a high click through rate (CTR) so use them to your advantage while blogging
This should ultimately direct traffic to your site
Blogs can be an excellent avenue from which other social media can drive content off
Keeping a Facebook like bar under every blog page is commonplace, and necessary, but you can also play around with sharable content in other ways
It is only when you get enough third party clicks on your blog that your blog moves up on the Google Search Rankings and drive clicks from Google searches
This should be a priority for you: searching on Google is now a default for most audiences new and old to the internet, and having a high position on the search list in regard to your product lends you more authority than any other thing
Get a theme color and some logos on your blog posts People need to feel that they are visiting your blog based on the layout, color pattern, themes, and other core aspects of your blog
In essence, a logo or theme color creates a sense of brand awareness
Don’t be afraid to develop a logo and theme color at the onset; actually, the earlier you start engaging your audience with all these features, the easier it will be for you to create a strong sense of brand awareness
These give a personal touch to your blog and enable it to stand out amongst the rest
Develop a blogging style and language and be yourself Your audience should be able to tell the difference between your posts and anyone else’s posts based on your way of thinking, your writing style, and everything else about your blog posts
This helps in developing your brand
The point is to humanize your blog as much as possible just to make sure that your audience feels truly connected to you
You should strive to show your personality through your blogging endeavors so that your audience can truly tell who you are
Good blogging leads to conversations  you can see on any good blog, that the blogger often converses with people in the comment section, to the extent of there being a community behind a blog
This can only be achieved by having a distinctive and characteristic voice that can be identified easily
Your goal must be that even without a logo or a brand print, your audience should be able to know that is you, by your writing style alone
Always treat your posts as your product On the Internet, the rule goes that if you are not paying for it, someone else is
As such, you cannot afford to sell yourself short by writing blog posts that don’t stand out
If you were developing a product, would you not use the best ingredients? Would you not constandy want to make it better? Before posting, be sure that people want that product (your blog post)
Gone are the days when consumers didn’t have an option on what they consumed
As such, you should get their input if you want to stand out from the competition
As I mentioned, if the reader is not paying the content, someone else will (is) (there is no free stuff)
As such, you should always think of whether someone would actually pay for your content before hitting the publish button
Don’t just give opinions on the subject; do your research if you are to stand out as an authority
That’s the only way you can say that you are providing content that someone would be willing to pay for
Give it all for free Don’t be afraid to publish content that you would actually make a living by selling
Your valuable advice is what makes you stand out as an authority
No one wants to steal your ideas
When people constandy find that you are always giving insights that they would not find elsewhere, you will be amazed by how many calls you will be getting from people who are hungry for information
Attempts to make money out of blog posts are really transparent and are not appreciated by most audiences
Instead, try to let your content on your blog be a teaser for your products
But your content should be your product by itself  you should take these teasers and other contents seriously
And let it be free
Have a clear call to action in each of your blog posts Always be selling but ensure that your blog posts don’t sound salesy
Instead, you can have a call to action at the end of each blog post
It could be share this blog, check out our products etc
Your call to action, of course, should not be transparent as one, but leaving something for the audience to do after perusing the contents of your blog can help each blog post be a part of the whole and do what it is supposed to do  sell your product and your brand
Guest post Guest post in reputable blogs so that you can drive traffic to specific social media sites through leaving signatures in your posts
You should also invite guest bloggers to post something on your site
This especially works magic if you feel pressed for time
It also works well when you want to give your audience a fresh perspective; this helps in bringing in some new eyes to the blog
It also helps in developing connections and friends who have similar tastes and ideas, and thus conversations and a sense of community around your blog
Same username Ensure that you use the same username when creating blog posts and various social media platforms
Quality content Showcase your expertise in the specific area by posting high quality informative blog posts that people will use as reference material when making various decisions or performing various tasks
Blogs focus almost exclusively on content  all kinds of post may be posted but they will all be heavy on content, and avoid posts that are heavy on direct advertisement
Thus it is important that the quality of your content be toporder and nuanced
When it comes to blogs, your content is your selling point and what will influence the further decisions of your audience with respect to your brand
This is what this section has been building up to
All the tips suggested above make it easier for you to know the kind of content your audience appreciates and needs
You should develop a certain kind of plan as to what you are going to be posting about, and then focus on developing quality content to that effect
Build trust The end goal to any social media plan would be to build trust and loyalty amongst your audience
Blogs, like every social media network are uniquely situated to building up loyalty and trust to the brand
This must be your end goal or one of your end goals for all ventures in social media marketing
Work towards building trust and relationships with your readers so that they feel comfortable buying products or services from you
You cannot afford to overlook the power of personal relationships in blogging since this drives traffic to your site by making people want to check out your opinion about a certain issue of interest to them
Consult your audience Ask for ideas from your followers; some people have ideas about different issues but simply need someone who they consider as an expert in a certain field to address that issue
You will be amazed at how many people will be willing to share ideas on what to blog about and what kind of products or services to offer in order to make them feel more satisfied
Building a community around your blog with responsive and excited audiences is not only a wellplanned social marketing plan, but also an immensely satisfying experience in itself
Inspire your readers Readers don’t just want to read about you all the time
They want to hear your perspective about different issues and how you can inspire them to achieve different goals
Readers want you to add value to their life as opposed to just entertaining them
Content is usually informative, but you do not need to inform them about your life
Your opinions, experiences, and ideas are of much more value to the world than you think  just remember to package it well for your readers
Make your blog easy to navigate Don’t give your audience a hard time in finding whatever content they are looking for on your site
Ensure that access to content can be done within the least number of clicks as possible
This is just another step from making sure that your blog looks good, distinctive, and striking
A clean and uncluttered interface makes your blog look far more appealing to audiences, and is easier to navigate to boot
Further, it also makes accessing your blog easier for people with low bandwidth and those on mobiles
Stop promoting on your business blog When people are visiting your blog posts, they are not looking for unending sales pitches from one post to another
They want to interact with your company on a personal level without feeling as if they are being pushed to buy stuff; they are hungry for information so provide information that adds real value to that reader
Try to write articles/posts that are not direcdy related to your product in order to provide real value to your readers and even prompt them to take action
Your blog must only refer to your product obliquely and in a tangential manner
Your blog cannot be the standalone advertising features for your product, except, of course, when your product is your blog itself
Your blog must add value first, and then sell by way of brand recall, trust, and voice
Strive to deal with negativity positively The truth is that there will be people who may not like the way you think, the way you do business and everything about you
Especially on social media, you are going to face negative reviews, reactions, and people who do not appreciate your product
There are a few ways of dealing with them
Instead of simply hitting the delete button even before you can go through all the negative comments, you should instead use these as an avenue to win your customers and even offer them guidance
Try to use their critique as constructive advice  look for a dialogue instead of conflict, and if there is a kernel of truth in their critique, acknowledge it graciously and attempt to work at the flaws
Initiating dialogue and conversations with respect to negative response makes you look genuine, and as someone who cares deeply and passionately about the medium, their product, their brand, and most importandy, about the opinions of their audience
In this way, you can actually make your response to a negative comment become something that advertises the way your brand responds to something, and wellconstructed debates and analysis online is appreciated by audiences
You could also try to find out if anything went wrong
You should let your business have a personality then let it shine through as it deals with all negativity and adversity; you shouldn’t be so scared about saying sorry! Claim authorship for your work This does not only mean putting your name at the end of a post, but the use of a “rel=author” tag, which is recommended by Google to claim authorship for your work
This tag is important because when you claim authorship for your published articles, your profile picture will show when next to all your articles on search results on Google
Essentially, every article you post anywhere on the web will link to your blog by virtue of your profile picture
This increases the CTR ranking for your blog, letting it reach higher for search results do with its contents, and thus direct traffic to your site by pushing it to become more relevant
Perhaps you should know that search results that have a Google+ profile picture often have a higher CTR than those that don’t have
Tag carefully Blogs give you the ability to tag your posts with different taglines
All posts that use a specific tagline can be seen under the tagline itself
In a sense, the tags work like hashtags on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram
However, because of the longevity of blogging as compared to other forms of social media, and because of the near limitless flexibility in terms of content, tags on blogs can drive up Google search results
Further, an effective and creative tag can become a byline for certain kinds of posts, can indicate contests, debates and discussions, and can signal the voice of the brand
Posts from your blogs only appear on Google search results depending on the tags, thus make sure to keep your tags simple and comprehensively
They should cover the main problems of your audience
Try to imagine what you would search on Google if you were looking for the solution your blog provides and tag accordingly
More importantly, do not tag indiscriminately, many tags together do not work as effectively as a few tags that cover the entire post well, and are a turnoff
Remember, the main goal of the tags is to drive search results to your blog
Titles do the magic Most of us click on blog posts because we find them descriptive of what we are looking for
In other instances, we click on them because they are catchy; we simply want to check out what the whole thing is all about
Experiment with different titles to find what works for you in capturing the attention of your target audience
Catchy titles make your work stand out from the rest, and grab the attention when displayed either on another social media platform or as one of many Google search results
Your post is basically competing for the attention of the audience with a bunch of other websites, who are trying to do the same things you are doing
A catchy title may be the difference between two or more posts in this regard
Posts on social media have a catch life of about fifteen minutes, after which they need to be bumped up to, receive any attention
In these fifteen minutes, you need to catch the attention of the audience so that they click on your page  and you do it via your title
However, because the title has become the most important part of the post for all, several titles choose to detract from the content itself and are catchy for the sake of it  this is called “click bait”, and is one of the most pronounced sins that you can do while marketing on social media
We will discuss more about it when we discuss things to avoid while on social media, but suffice to say at this point that headlines that do not have anything to do with the post, are misleading, or even contradictory are not appreciated at all as cheap ways to catch some attention
Coming up with a catchy and meaningful title is a creatively challenging task, with great results if you get the hang of it
The most important requirement is almost always practice
The title should never summarize, but also point to what your post is all about
Different posts work better with different tides, and the kind of brand voice you have influences the tide as well
Share, Repost, and Collaborate with other Blogs Mentioned under the Guest Writers tag, however, you want to keep an eye on other blogs that cover similar topics, content and posts like yourself
Unlike most of the world of advertising, which can be a series of cutthroat competition, blogging is a very collaborative space
There is never enough good content
Watch out for other blogs and share good content that they post (with the appropriate credits, of course!) if it is related to the kind of content you post
To that effect, websites like WordPress and Tumblr have implemented the ReBlog feature, which is similar to the Retweet feature in Twitter
These help you increase the profile of the other blog, but also catch their attention
If you have any insight into their content, do comment and let them know  initiate a conversation and discussion with which the audiences of both the blogs can benefit, and perhaps you may even be able to start up a collaboration with another blog, providing great content, the audience of the other blog, and exciting avenues to explore in the world of blogging
TIPS ON HOW TO USE TWITTER TO DOMINATE Twitter is the second largest social media site after Facebook with over 280 million monthly users and up to 500 million tweets sent daily
This is definitely a huge market to market your products but the challenge is; how do you do that with just 140 characters per tweet? In actuality, it is the 140 character limit that makes Twitter such an interesting medium to use for social media, and using it appropriately is not only creatively satisfying, but owing to the relatively slow manner in which advertisers have taken to Twitter
How do you use the famous hashtags and other features that Twitter provides users to drive traffic to your blog, website or other social media sites? Here are some actionable tips to help you get the most out of Twitter
Tips on social media branding through twitter Know what you want You need to know about what you want from all social media platforms, but it is the most important facet of marketing on Twitter
You can only know the nature of information that you will be tweeting if you know what you really want
Are you a blogger wishing to share ideas and content about what you write about or do you simply want to be sharing news or following celebrities? Tweeting generally takes the form of sharing information in the form of videos or other media, sharing news articles, and other forms of pertinent articles on the web that have to do with the kind of topics you wish to talk about
When you know your purpose, you will definitely be tweeting on relevant topics
Make the Twitter handle (name) exacdy the same as your other Social Media application’s page names
This is selfexplanatory, but having a common name around all social media platforms helps improve brand recall and consciousness, and makes it easier for you to distribute your content around your social media platforms
Twitter is usually not the single form of marketing, and thus works as a way to engage the very large audience towards the platform that you do use for your product
For example, if you are a photographer, you might want to use Instagram: Twitter works well in gaining attention towards your Instagram and thus increase the publicity of your main medium of choice
Make sure your profile has keywords This will make it easier for people to search you on Twitter
You should also publish your Twitter handle in other platforms simply to attract a new following
Your author bio in your blog, for example, or on any guest, should contain your Twitter handle
For a lot of people, Twitter is the preferred form of communication as it allows a person to be the most accessible compared to other social media platforms
Twitter also has a helpful verified option that can help you verify your account to represent your brand
Your profile should be a creative and clever way to introduce yourself or your brand, (depending on what you’re marketing) and be representative of the kind of work you do and your products
Provide all the required and relevant information while creating your Twitter account, as it will make people more aware of your business
• Give your audience reason to want to follow you Ensure that you give your audience some form of incentive of why they should follow you
For instance, you could offer exclusive access to something that your audience would be interested in
Post regular offers and promotions for stuff that your audience finds amazing
Knowledgeable and wellcurated content can make your Twitter worth following
Remember, one of the ways in which media goes viral on Twitter is through its retweet function  you never know when good content becomes one of the most shared topics of the day
So keep your content informative, brief and well thought out
As in all social media, images have better tractions than just text on Twitter, and thus use them judiciously to push engagement with your Twitter profile
Avoid using special characters and punctuations so that users will be able to reach your website with ease
Twitter is truly a world medium, and thus making your posts simple and easy to understand is imperative to connect with audiences who are not as comfortable with the language(s) you use
Customize your Twitter profile to make it more interactive and attractive
Make it look more like you
Your goal is to develop a social media brand so try to use the same branding features you have on your Facebook profile on Twitter
However, Twitter is slightly different from Facebook, in that it is not necessarily so personal, and that it works much better with brief and concise words as compared to Facebook
Engage: Follow people or businesses that you consider important based on the industry they are in and the kind of stuff they tweet about
Go on to favorite tweets, retweet tweets, and respond to tweets
This works in that people will start listening to you when they notice that you are acknowledging or listening to them
Likewise, if anyone follows you or even mentions you on Twitter, you should try to respond to them and even thank them
Retweet any great content that you find
You will realize that more people will start engaging you when you engage them
Look for weekly chats and participate in the conversations
In this case, engage them with hashtags but ensure that you don’t overuse them (one or two is just okay)
Also, ensure that you don’t use hashtags that could easily make your content end up being grouped with inappropriate content
The follow feature is indeed a very powerful one; it is one of the most powerful data metrics available to you to measure your social media worth
You can use the follow feature to find pertinent and important information that you can further retweet to your own followers
In turn, the posts that you tweet will be retweeted by your own followers to do well in social media
Your hashtags can further help in making your posts engage further
Alternate your tweeting times The best way to know when your audience is listening is through alternating your tweeting times until you find what works for you in attracting maximum engagement
This is where the flexibility of social media helps you to experiment when and where your target audience is located, and what kind of information and content appeals to them
Be creative in your content creation Use the 140 characters you have at your disposal to craft captivating tweets
In some instances, you might need to retweet other people’s tweets or content unlike creating your own content
As you do that, ensure that you keep in mind why you are doing it, who is your target audience and what you hope to achieve through that
While the limit of 140 characters may seem daunting, the limitation can really exercise your creative juices to come up with creative, memorable, and appreciated tweets
Twitter especially works well with humorous and edgy content, but there is no restriction to be placed in this regard, even perfecdy serious posts can stand out from the rest of the crowd
Work on the kind of tweets you can make, but remember that above all the content must be pertinent to the kind of brand voice and identity that you wish to build up
The same joke might work well if you’re representing a food brand, but might not if you’re representing, say, a brand that sells luxury watches
In this regard, also be aware of the trending topics of the day and take advantage of the hashtags to respond to the topic in a way that connects your brand to it
Remember, you cannot post about everything under the sun, so unless you can think of something extraordinary and engaging, do not post on Twitter
Try to keep to a schedule, reblog interesting articles and tweets you find interspersed with your own original content
Make sure to not let your audience be bored
Be captivating: Learn to use pictures to pass 1000 words as opposed to relying on the 140 characters at your disposal
Use inline images in your tweets to generate more followers
As you do that, use images that speak positively about your brand
You will notice that tweets with images have more favorites and retweets
According to the Twitter Media Blog, posts that have images attract over 30% more engagement than the standard tweets
The reason this is so is that humans are incredibly visual
We tend to remember things better when they are presented visually
To this effect, Twitter also provides increased metrics to pictures, making it likelier for pictures to appear on the newsfeeds and twitterfeeds of followers than those tweets that do not contain images
Therefore, it is clear that you should be relentiess in your image creation
Share infographics that explain some complex concepts in simple and few words
In doing so, you are bound to have far more engagement than constandy tweeting empty (with no image) tweets
If a photo speaks 1000 words, then a video does speak 10,000 words simply because it can help “edutain” your followers and spur conversations
As I mentioned, people are very visual
Actually, a video can help you increase engagement by over 25 percent
Although photos as mentioned above have more engagement, it has been proven that videos usually have a greater effect in building relationships with followers
As such, you will find that videos can help you nurture followers until they become customers
You don’t have to post a very complicated video; simply posting a photo of yourself doing something in your business could be all you need to start engagement
In comparison with images and words, videos are much more likely to find better engagement
Remember to keep your videos brief for those who have slow Internet connections
The short videoposting app Vine is an incredible addition to the already formidable arsenal of apps compatible with Twitter  you can post short 46 seconds of video footage to drive engagement to your Twitter feed
As a rule of thumb, ensure that you have a clear call to action in each video then drive people to the relevant landing page on your site where whatever product or service you are selling is available
You can do all that on YouTube
You can also hire professionals to create your videos for you
Consistency Consistency is key in any social media marketing effort
You can do so through creating tweets that are in line with your brand’s tone, mission and vision
Ensure that your voice is unique and active on Twitter
Also, ensure that you are consistent with as far as timing for Twitter is concerned
If you are usually active on Twitter on specific days, be active on those days
You could even automate the tweeting process to ensure that you don’t miss an important moment to tweet
Further, you can schedule tweets to ensure they appear at the times of the day and the days of the week in which you want them to appear in
Most importandy, remember to keep your Twitter feed uncluttered
If you have a post announcing a contest, new product, or anything that you wish to highlight, give it some time at the top of your newsfeed
Consider making a cover picture with the words to drive engagement
This will make your followers expect something from you during those days, which can ultimately grow your audience
Take note of trending hashtags You can ride on a trending hashtag to promote your business
For instance, you can ride on such hashtags like cybermonday, TGIF, Travel Tuesdays, Terrific Tuesdays and any other popular tags
Just check the popular tags and figure out how you can add value to the conversation while ensuring that you promote your business
Try to offer an attractive deal to get guys to like your page
Trending hashtags drive engagement to your Twitter feed by virtue of a number of people who follow trending topics
Try to add a unique spin on the trending topic, to make your entry stand out from the many others that mention the topic as well
Make sure, however, that your spin on the topic is relevant and pertinent to the information that you usually share and the kind of identity you wish to create with respect to your brand, if you cannot find a way to incorporate something then just do not, because there is a multitude of trending topics for you to choose from
Learn to manage your Twitter account professionally You should experiment with tweeting at different times to learn when best to engage your audience because they are listening
Also, there is a limit on the number of times you should probably tweet; you can only know that when you experiment
You could also schedule your tweets and monitor notifications to ensure that you have an organized way of doing things
Identify influencers and work with them to grow your presence Whether you run an online or offline business, you can seek a popular blogger within your niche then offer him or her a good deal (say a commission, discount or upfront payment) for tweeting about your business
You could then have that blogger have a unique discount code that anyone who buys from you through him or her uses to access a discount
This is a winwin for both of you because you get followers while the blogger gets to strengthen his or her following for getting good deals for his readers or followers
Help people If you know something that someone else might not know, don’t be afraid to tweet about that
The level of positive response that you will get from those who find your tweet very helpful will amaze you
The rule of thumb is that you ought to treat others how you would want them to treat you if the roles were reversed
If you would sometimes want someone to help you on something, don’t just withhold information that you know can help that person
Just like in blogging, don’t be afraid to share it all because this will definitely pay back in multiples
For instance, if you are attending a conference, which is bound to attract people who don’t live within your city, you could for instance tweet about the best hotels, best restaurants, best gyms, best cabs, best night out joints, best churches, fun things to do in your area and many other things

Stats and data have been proven to attract 17% more engagement
They are also safer to tweet, as they are less likely to attract negative attention
This does not mean that you should not share your opinion, but when doing so, you must be understanding and conscious of the different kind of followers and opinions you have
You must be respectful, empathetic yet stick to your own point of view
Nevertheless, in this day and age of politically correct responses, it is very likely that your content is actually offensive to someone sometimes
Tweeting statistically correct data is helpful because it eliminates such responses (well, almost) and is easier to crosscheck
Tweet quotes The Internet is a haven for all kinds of content  it has been very difficult to analyze the different kinds of content and find out how many people seem to appreciate that kind of content
This makes sense: there are many different people, and obviously they all like different things
However, there is one key exception to what seems to be the rule
Most people simply seem to like famous quotes about a certain matter of importance to them
Actually, if someone finds a quote that relates to an issue of interest, they are likely to retweet it or favorite it
A study done on 2million tweets showed that tweets containing quotes received 19% more engagement than standard tweets with no quotes
Find quotes that are relevant to the kind of engagement and information that you post regularly  your audience is likely to appreciate it as well
Further, if you can present this quote in an elegant image, it is likely to engage even better with your audience

TIPS ON HOW TO USE YOUTUBE TO DOMINATE 'YouTube is the most popular video channel with over 30 million daily visits and over 100 hours of video posted every single minute
This makes it a great avenue to establish your online brand
Nevertheless, the coundess videos posted every single day onto the thousands of other videos could easily make any videos you publish end up being buried deep within the many others such that you end up not reaching out to your target audience
Just like in every other social media channel, the secret to success is getting a following or audience to broadcast your videos to
Actually, the more views you get, the more popular your videos will be and the greater success you will have in ranking highly on the search results
YouTube’s popularity is reflected in the native support it receives on Facebook, Twitter, and Android
YouTube thus is a great way to engage audiences because it can easily be accessed through the popular social media platforms
It is worthwhile to note that Google+ is required to use all the features of YouTube, giving access to another formidable social media platform
Its popularity, however, also means that you must have to deal with a lot of competition to receive any attention from people on YouTube
However, it is possible to do so with your followers from other social media channels owing to YouTube’s flexibility and functionality, and thus earn a lot of viewers and followers by cross posting your videos to other sites
In short, YouTube is an excellent and exciting opportunity to drive engagement towards your brand
Here are some tips to get you started when creating and promoting your YouTube channel
Setting up the channel and initial design: When creating your YouTube channel, ensure that you use your company’s name and any relevant branding resources to ensure that your channel is easily identifiable to your target audience
Also, ensure that you have a clear, catchy and straightforward company description
Look for ways of linking your YouTube channel to your other social media pages to ensure cross promotion
You can also do cross promotion through linking your channel to other pages that you are affiliated with
YouTube is especially flexible when it comes to the purpose of cross promotion  as mentioned earlier, it receives native support on the most popular social networks today
When you start, the next step is to promote your channel to ensure that you get the most views to your videos
Here are some tips to get more views: #Set up an email signature that features a link to your YouTube videos Through that, your email recipients will probably want to check out your videos
You can be changing the link when you want to promote a new video through the email signature
Choose the video for your signature judiciously
It should definitely be indicative of the kind of videos your audience can expect to find  but must also be entertaining enough that your audience watches the whole thing
This method is a way in which you can guarantee that some people shall link to your video, but to keep them hooked on to your videos requires a grasp on the kind of content you wish to post
Also, you can post a link to your website in the description section just to drive traffic to your site
Ensure that your URL starts with http:// since this is the only way YouTube can detect that the content is a link
#Post high quality videos that subtly attract people to click on them In this case, you should strive to shoot and upload all your videos in HD format
As such, you must ensure that your videos are shot in an environment with very good lighting
Use a professional camera, and learn the basics of camera angles if you do not know them already
It is your responsibility to ensure that your viewers are able to see clearly
Further, you do not want your audience to be distracted from your videos
All these further make your videos look attractive and interesting
Keep your videos short You really don’t have to do hours of video to pass your message across
Actually, more people are likely to watch short videos than extremely long ones so keep that in mind when creating videos
It is important to keep a constant length for your videos  people enjoy similar patterns, and more importandy, it makes the oneoff video that is longer or shorter than the norm stand out
These one off videos should be special ones that announce a major event, a launch of a product, and other such important events
#Ensure your blogs have a link to your YouTube channel In another note relating to cross posting, it is imperative to link your YouTube channel to your blog or website
To that effect, blogging platforms such as WordPress, Blogger and Tumblr provide a widget that allows your YouTube videos to easily be accessed
This will make it easy to attract your readers to your channel, which ultimately increases views and subscribers to both, your blog, and your YouTube channel
#Have a catchy thumbnail To be honest, most of us only click on YouTube videos that already seem to be descriptive of what we are looking for
We mostly judge this by looking at the thumbnail
Make sure the thumbnail is representative of the kind of video it is, because otherwise it will be seen as misleading, and your video may also receive down votes for that reason
Therefore, ensure that you have one that is highly captivating to maximize clicks to your channel
#Strive to ride on hot topics when creating titles Although you shouldn’t be misleading in your tides, using hot tides will increase your chances of adracting an audience through organic search
This works in a similar manner with the thumbnail
A catchy tide can increase the number of views on your videos to a large extent
The tide of the video drives in quite a few clicks, and therefore it is important that they be catchy, representative, and indicative of your content
As with all others, coming up with the ideal tide is a difficult task, but it becomes easier with practice
After a while, you will be able to write a headline in a jiffy
#Brand your videos through having a logo or channel name At the beginning of the video and at the end of the video, you may want to consider adding a logo and other effects indicating your brand
You could even have a video effects editor to animate your logo and anything that could make your channel even better
The video effects that accompany your logo could also become indicative of your brand, and would improve brand recall and recognition
#Unleash the power of annotations You can interlink YouTube videos through annotations (these can appear at the top left and at the top right corner of each video whereby the ones at the bottom link to the previous video while the ones at the top link to the next video)
You can use annotations to develop a menu screen at the end of each video whereby the viewer is presented with other videos that he or she can choose from
With this option, it will be a lot easier for people to navigate between all your videos, which in turn result to more views
Additionally, you can use annotations to point users to a playlist or the page that prompts the viewers to subscribe to your channel
In this manner, you can link your viewers from one video to another and drive views towards your content
Annotating your videos can help making your videos accessible, and the playlists, or the campaign videos become easily available in order for the viewers
#Transcribe your videos too for SEO purposes
The content on your transcribed video will also add to the keywords, which will in turn help in driving traffic to your videos since the content is usually searchable
This will drive the Google page rank of your YouTube videos higher, and thus make them more likely to appear on the front pages when searching for the appropriate keywords
Transcribing is also incredibly helpful for people who are not comfortable with the language you have used in the video
#Let some background music do its thing: Don’t just post silent videos (they suck!)
Ensure that you have some background music for your videos just to break the boredom of watching a 2minute video without any sound
Remember to source the background music appropriately; and use the effects creatively in your video itself if you can  the best YouTubers use background music cleverly and appropriately to drive tension within their videos
#Add your videos to a playlist Group similar videos (those with similar keywords) together in order to make better placement in the searches
Also, search those with playlists that match your search preferences then add them to your playlist
This drives the page rank of your videos higher, sorts your video and makes them easier for consumption, and places the keywords together to make the videos easier to find
#Share your YouTube videos on other social media sites Whenever you upload a video, share it in your networks like Facebook and Twitter and ask your friends to share it or like it as well
Ensure that each video has a clear call to action asking viewers to subscribe to or share the videos
You can opt to use this in the middle or at the end of the video
Another appropriate call to action is merely to call for discussion about the video
If you can get your video to trend on other media sites as YouTube with its native functionality on many social media channels is bound to see, you can increase engagement with your video manifold
#Ensure that you optimize all video metadata This will ensure that you drive more traffic through Google searches
Metadata includes functions like annotations, thumbnails, tides, descriptions, and tags
Also, ensure that the name of the raw video file is identical to the keywords you are trying to rank highly
This will drive the video higher and increase its page rank
Because YouTube is a subsidiary of Google, YouTube automatically gets a higher placement on its search engine compared to other video sites such as Dailymotion and Vimeo
#Don’t overlook the power of captions If you don’t want to lockout people who have hearing problems, you can use captions in your YouTube videos (captions are simply the YouTube’s subtitles)
These captions also come in handy for those who want to watch videos without turning on their volume
Additionally, the content is also searchable on YouTube’s search, which in turn means you will find it easier to rank
To add captions, click edit a video then choose the captions tab
However, note that the captions tab on YouTube is prone to errors
Make sure to check if it is working appropriately or not
If not, you might want to invest and create captions for your YouTube videos by yourself instead of relying on YouTube’s native caption app
#Ensure that you have a consistent pattern Upload new videos in a regular, consistent pattern to your YouTube channel
This predictability is very critical if you want to have a dedicated following
More than anything else, YouTube channels can get loyal visitors owing to the subscribe function wherein those who have subscribed to your channel get notified about every video you make
These people would be happy to check out each and every one of your videos  make it easier for them to do so by posting videos at allotted time intervals
You may also want to indicate the time you will be posting your next video at the end of a video
On the same note, if you’re going to be absent from YouTube for a while, it may be worthwhile to mention a possible date by which time you would return
#Ensure that you engage your followers constantly Respond to comments, suggestions and other forms of feedback from your audience
Your response can either be in the comment section of your videos, or in other videos by themselves
You can participate in several engagement opportunities in this regard by answering questions from your audience, participating in giveaways and other such activities
Your responses should be prompt (don’t take weeks or months to respond to other people’s comments!) and polite
There are a lot of YouTube commenters who are nothing but trouble, and how you engage with them would indicate your success with the community
#Partner with bloggers within your niche Bloggers and other vloggers who share similar themes or content with you would probably be willing to share high quality and informative videos on their blogs and media platforms
With this option, you will generate more leads, more views and more subscribers
You will also have a valuable backlink to your video
Actually, having your video embedded in a page with a high page rank increases your chances of ranking highly on YouTube
You might need to give them an incentive to promote your video on their blog
You can as well have a blog that features the video
#Be selling You should have a clear call to action in your videos
Ask viewers what you want them to do; it could be “subscribe to my channel”, “click on the link in the description”, “leave a comment”, “like my video”, “share with friends”, “add video to favorites” etc
You can present the call to action through an annotation or in person; whichever way you do it, you will notice that there will be an increase in engagement
Such an annotation gives your commenters something to do, and thus drives up engagement
Contrariwise, if you’re spreading information about something, you can provide links for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic
For example, if you mention a charity, you can leave a link to the charity’s website for your audience to use if they wish to donate
You can measure the amount of clicks made to such a website to measure how well your call to action does
TIPS ON HOW TO DOMINATE LINKEDIN Linkedln is the third biggest social networking site after Facebook and Twitter and the #1 professional networking site with over 200 million users
This presents limidess opportunities when you establish a strong brand presence on the social media site
Linkedln is a very useful site for B2B advertising, where you can try to interest not your audience itself but other brands with your own brand
A strong brand presence means having as many connections as possible and engaging them actively
As you start your journey towards exerting your dominance in Linkedln, you should perhaps keep some of the following statistics in mind because Linkedln is different from Facebook, Twitter and any other social network: 68%+ of users in Linkedln are older than 35 years
72%+ of users in Linkedln are college grads 66%+ of users in Linked in earn more than $60,000 annually
The good think about Linkedln is that interaction is a lot more professional than in any other social site; you won’t be posting photos of your recent wild parties on your profile lest your future boss sees that! The primary thing you’ll be marketing on Linkedln would be yourself  your audience? Future clients and employers
Thus your Linkedln presence must be professional and elegandy displayed
So, how can you stand out while presenting yourself professionally in Linkedln? Here is how to get there: #The first step is to create a Linkedln company page Here is where you will be engaging your followers by posting news, events, content and other updates
You will be amazed that having a Linkedln page will also help you rank higher on the search engines
This is not so much because of Linkedln’s reach, but because a profile on Linkedln and a presence on the website indicates to several people that the brand is professional
Thus a presence in Linkedln is enough by itself to build up a level of trust amongst your audience
Research has already shown that up to 50% of the members of Linkedln are likely to buy from the companies that usually engage them on Linkedln
Once you create a page, you need to optimize that page so that it can show whatever your company offers
You could even build a products and services page on your page to attract more people
Ensure that you are very convincing on why people should follow you
Linkedln company pages are also highly SEO friendly; Google even shows a preview of up to 156 characters so you need to have a compelling description that captivates everyone
Use relevant keywords as well
Don’t forget to have your company’s contact information, and any other information relating to your areas of expertise in this page
After doing that, ensure that you ask your customers to endorse your products or services
This company page will be the hub for all audiences to see  a hall or a boarding room if you will
Thus it should be clean, and clutter free, but also elegant and striking in terms of design
#Complete your profile : People want to know who they are interacting with on Linkedln
Actually, the system is set in a way that makes it hard to find connections when you haven’t filled your profile
As such, upload a good photo or logo of your company and complete every entry until your profile shows 100% complete
You can also post previous jobs or projects on the page just to show your credibility
A complete profile provides the best opportunity for connections and engagement, and provides clients and interested audiences with all the necessary details about your company
HEngage with your audience Engage with your audiences as much as possible by responding to member comments
Ensure you interact with people in corporate blogs, company posts and product updates to ensure that you always keep knowledge of your company in people’s minds
Also, ensure that you customize content to your customer’s or followers professional interests since this resonates with them
You can do that through sharing your content to all followers or to a specific targeted audience based on level of seniority, company size, industry or geography
Targeted engagement is a must have if you are to succeed in Linkedln
Always ensure that your posts start with catchy introductions and headlines; keep in mind that the audience won’t read your posts if they don’t find them captivating
However, captivating in Linkedln is not necessarily the same as captivating your audiences in Facebook or Twitter
The much more formal atmosphere in Linkedln requires tides that are formal, very short, and descriptive
As with all social media platforms, the ideal title in this regard will come to you via practice
Also, ensure that you keep your titles short (4049 characters)
Nonetheless, you can always have the freedom to experiment to find out what works for you
The audience determines what is interesting by a simple overview of the first two or three sentences so ensure that you start on a high note
Additionally, keep in mind that questions don’t really make good or captivating titles on Linkedln
Also, ensure that your content is of high value to your readers by ensuring that you write something easy to consume and easy to share
This in essence should include such things like pictures, chats, articles, videos etc
You could also ask questions to engage your audience more
#Add a Linkedln button on your website You may even add one to your email and blog’s signature
This would ensure that it is easy for other Linkedln members to follow you in a single click
Thus when sending mailers or when recommending your blog, website or any other web platform, add a Linkedln button to be seen clearly, yet unobtrusively to your media
#Set up a custom URL Simply click edit profile then click edit (just besides the public profile section)
After doing that, check into the right bar on an option for customizing your URL
Ideally, your customized URL should be the name of your brand or the name of your other social media platforms so that it can be found easily
Also make it quick and easy to type
#Send updates about job openings to your connections
Also, search and answer various questions on Linkedln and join groups that you can participate in
You could even create your own group to discuss different issues of interest to your audience
Remember that you must have a serious and well thought out plan on the kinds of information you wish to be sharing with your audience  create a group around this concept
#Start some Linkedln campaigns Linkedln campaigns can be used to engage your audience with a combination of a set plan, theme, and content
By exploring around with different ideas of content, you should find out what kind of content receives the best engagement statistics, and incorporate that into a campaign to maximize your engagements
Further cross post to other social media to drive engagement further
#P romote your Linkedln page Link your Linkedln profile on other social media accounts you have to drive traffic to your page
For instance, connecting your Linkedln profile with your Twitter account can be a good idea
One way of setting up your account for that is to auto post your tweets in your Linkedln status
Another good way is to choose to send tweets that have #in hashtag to your Linkedln profile
This ensures that you keep your profile clean and professional
Connecting your Linkedln profile to your Twitter profile can drive engagement with both
If you’ve set your Linkedln feed to automatically post whatever you tweet, be careful while tweeting; not all kinds of posts are appreciated and find a place in Linkedln
#Use Linkedln publishing to grow your network According to Linkedln 
Linkedln users who usually consume professional content usually spend about 8 hours every week reading about industry trends and news
You can leverage on the power of Linkedln publishing to grow an audience
You should ideally create posts that are between 19002000 words since this has been proven to attract more shares, views and comments
These posts offer you an opportunity to truly engage with your audience without the help of catchy but misleading headlines, tags or otherwise
The thing you should be focusing the most on should be content
You should as well post regularly and engage your audience consistendy if you really want to grow a large readership
Here are some more tips on success with Linkedln publishing
Think of a middle school audience: Don’t write posts that are too complicated for people to comprehend
Even if the audience is largely an educated lot, most people still want to read posts written in an easy to understand writing style
Not only are they easier to understand, they also make it easier for you to write without committing any errors or mistakes
These attract more shares, views, and comments
Don’t be too opinionated: Try to jog people’s minds instead of providing a good or bad opinion about an issue of interest
Everybody is opinionated, and thus just sharing your opinion may cause a backlash
Instead, try to be as objective as possible
If you’re going to post your opinion, make it clear that it is just so, and try to respect and acknowledge those who do not share the same opinions as well
If you really want to post your opinion, back your points with statistical data; you will really come out as an authority in your profession
Use images: As I have been insisting, an image speaks 1000 words so use it to capture people’s attention and attract engagement
You should ideally use 8 images to attract the maximum engagement in terms of shares, comments and views for each of your posts
Videos don’t really add much value to engagement on Linkedln
Break your content into small chunks for easy reading
Don’t forget to use HI, H2, H3 tags to break your posts for easy reading and improved performance
It has been proven that 59 headings perform better
TIPS ON HOW TO DOMINATE GOOGLE+ (joogle plus is increasingly becoming popular making it a great tool to use in order to engage your audience in a better way
Built as direct competition to the stranglehold of Facebook and Twitter to online social media, Google+ combines the heavy presence of Gmail (the #1 email client of the world) among its desired audience to create a rival social media presence
Google+ replaces the friends and followers button you would be used to in Facebook and Twitter in favor of the “Circles” feature, which places friends, relatives and other contacts in varying circles depending on what kind of privacy setting you wish to set in front of every group
Thus in comparison to Facebook, Google+ provides much more flexibility in privacy setting and in targeted advertising
Further, Google+ accounts use information generated from the respective Gmail accounts, which signify that you have access to a lot of data about your clients
In addition, Google+ natively supports YouTube and other Google owned media, such as Google Docs, Hangout etc
To balance this, however, advertising on Google+ is still not as nuanced as it is on Facebook, and it is a much smaller social network in size and in terms of bandwidth
Apart from certain brands, it is just not costeffective to advertise on Google+
But if you feel that you can really make a splash on the platform, here are some tips to help you solidify your brand on Google+
#Optimize your Google+ profile Try to make your profile appear on the search pages while ensuring that it is captivating to your audience
Your brand colors and logo should be added to the profile and any other information that you would want your business to be identified with
As I have already mentioned, it is best to use a profile that is consistent across different social networks
#Use Hangout cleverly Hangout is the proprietary chatting and video chatting software that is built into Gmail and Android
Think of it like Skype, except with more options and wider availability
Use Hangouts to communicate with your customers in case of oneonone communications, such as to thank or praise certain groups of customers, as this provides direct facetoface interaction between customers and businesses
You can get valuable insight on how to enhance customer experience, audience demographics, and audience loyalty through Hangouts
#Get your customers to participate You can host a Hangout, with which, due to the facetoface interaction, you can give your customers an opportunity to participate in the process of your business
You could blend this with allowing your audience to see the human aspect of your business
You are not restricted to Hangout alone; other aspects can do so as well such as videos, advertisements, and the like
However, hosting a Hangout is absolutely one of the easiest ways through which you can make customers have that kind of experience owing to its video chatting functionality
#Promote your content on Google+ Further, ensure that you use Google+ as part of your email signature as well as on your blog, website, or other social media
Make sure that you can give users the option to 'like 5 your content on Google+ by providing the unique + button clearly on your content on emails, websites, and other content
Just as Facebook likes, individual blog posts can also receive a lot of attention from the simple, unobtrusive, and clearly visible button on the screen
This is referred to as Google+ badge
As I have already mentioned, cross promotion will be a majorly important asset in driving your social media brand to success
On that note, remember that a majority of the people in Google+ actually have presences in other social media such as Twitter or Facebook
When crossposting, remember to keep content fresh for all your social media groups, otherwise your social media presence would be considered stale and boring
#Participate in communities Communities work very similarly to the concept of Facebook groups
You can find great opportunities for engaging with others on Google+ through the community feature
Participating in communities which deal in the topics and conversations that are of interest to you drive traffic to your profile
In this context, converse with people; provide insight as well as gain insight from others in the community
Your presence in the community serves to increase the profile of the brand you represent, so maintain the kind of voice you’d want to be associated with the brand and work on aspect of increasing your profile
You can combine this with using Ripples to determine the effect of different marketing techniques in enhancing your brand image
#Use images and videos Just as in every social media network, data suggests that content containing images is more likely to be memorable and remembered by audiences
This hearkens back to humans being highly visual and sensory
Try to fascinate your target audience; Google+ like other social media platforms seeds images higher than plain text, so use this to your advantage
The more you captivate anyone who sees your posts, the bigger the following you shall receive
TIPS ON HOW TO DOMINATE INSTAGRAM Wi* over 200 million active users, Instagram stands to be a great tool for you to tap into the immense potential that the platform offers in generating leads and increasing conversions
It is an enormously growing social media network, especially amongst youth, and boasts high levels of engagement and interest from its expanding user base
For a brand that focuses on youth, Instagram looks like, and is, an exciting avenue for exploration, but there are a few things that you must keep in mind about Instagram, as it is slighdy different from the other social media networks we have been discussing so far
For example, before you can jump right into Instagram, you should probably understand that you wouldn’t have the luxury of publishing links to your eCommerce site, pushing sales, and pumping products through coundess advertorial copies
You can only stand out based on how you set up contests, how your profile looks like, and how you create your photos
Instagram is a photoheavy site, while text can be posted along with pictures; they are casted direcdy as just accompaniment
That is why Instagram works so much better with brands and companies that can easily be seen in the form of the photograph  food, clothing and travel
While it is not limiting in the least, these are the primary fields in which you can make a difference with a campaign
A lot of Instagram is just trying to carve out a space with your photographs that can stand out amongst the rest
So, how can you stand out from the competition? #Create a k il ler Instagram profile Let me explain how you can achieve that:  Use highresolution photos : Highresolution photographs are a must to grab the attention of potential customers
While there is a lot of high quality photography on Instagram, it is still populated for the most part by amateur photographers with their phone cameras
The professional photograph in high resolution always stands out amongst such photographs
These are likely to grab the attention of potential buyers with a lot of ease
If you want to stand out from everyone else who is using smartphones to capture photos, get a good camera or hire a professional to take highresolution photos for you
 If you are selling, make it easy to buy : Characteristic of Instagram is the low attention times that dot the landscape of social media today
It has one of the fastest newsfeeds, in that your post will hardly be on the front page for a few seconds
If you are selling something, ensure that you make it absolutely easy for people to buy
You can do this through posting an image description to include a link to the specific page where that product can be purchased
This can greatiy maximize conversions
Anything more complicated than a single click is likely, on the other hand, to reduce conversions
Keep it simple
 Avoid hard selling : Try not to sell direcdy on Instagram  it is not a medium that is conducive for such a strategy
Instagram has a very casual and personal feel towards it, so you can probably benefit much more by posting photographs featuring what your audience could do with your products and services
Just feature a single hint as to where your audience can find these products in a simple manner with a single link to a buying page or your blog in the post description section
This subde selling strategy gready helps connect with the audience, which ultimately results to increased engagement and conversions
You can greatly boost your company’s reputation by posting inthe moment photos that make your audience feel more connected to your business
These could include pictures from an office picnic, a birthday party, or a session with some experts
Get your audiences to know more about the personal nature of your brand, to make it more connected with them
 Nurture the habit of using Instagram Direct : Instagram Direct is an incredibly useful feature that is perhaps not fully understood by many
This service enables users to send messages to specific users
You can target your recipients based on their location and demographics
This means greater engagement and higher conversions
In essence, Instagram Direct is a feature that can serve as an advertisement, where you can target specific profiles by the little data they share with Instagram
It is clear that it is an incredibly powerful feature
Since it has been proven that the most active fans are the ones who convert more, you can simply find the users who are the most active and then send them messages introducing new products or introduce giveaways (promotions) and even run contests
You can also use this option to drive traffic to your website
You can provide them with some incentive to do so, as well as a code by which users who are directed towards your brand receive an incentive as well, converting more visitors direcdy, and benefiting the active user and encouraging them to continue working with you
 Free offers and discounts : Conversely, the broad audience of Instagram is always ready to take advantage of contests and discounts
Try having strategic offers and discounts on your profile to build engagement and increase the number of visits
People love free goodies, and they will not only be willing to visit your profile often to see if an offer is available, but if you can encourage them to judiciously use the tag a friend feature as part of a, say, contest, you can drive even more traffic to your profile
You can also blend these occasions with regular giveaways and contests to get people to keep coming back to your page
As you do this, ensure that you use a special hashtag created for the specific giveaway so that it is easily recognized, especially make sure that the hashtags have the name of your brand in them to drive up brand recall and engagement
# Stream your Instagram photos on your website : This simple procedure helps in increasing visibility to your Instagram profile and makes your website look good as well
This gready helps in building awareness about your brand
As your audience grows, you can start generating buzz about your brand through private and public campaigns, contests, and giveaways
Instagram is home to some of the most prolific contest campaigns, because its audiences are far likelier to participate in contests and giveaways
What kind of contests can you have? >Like to win contests In these contests, you simply ask your audience to like a specific post after which they will automatically be enrolled in the contest to stand a chance to win amongst everyone who likes the post
These are extremely easy to enter, and are easy to arbitrate as well
All you need to do is set up a random generator to select the winner
These kinds of contest work extremely well when you have a large audience and do not have much time to come up with a more sophisticated contest
Obviously, however, they do not build the brand all that well
These are very easy to enter, easy to set up and easy to use to grow an audience
However, they have low engagement and low consumer engagement
Hashtag user generated contest Simply set up a hashtag for your contest then ask users to post a photo or video, and then use the contest’s hashtag to participate
The best photograph or video can be decided either by its popularity or by the brand, depending on your choice
This helps strengthen your connection with the audience and helps popularize your brand especially if the hashtag has your brand name in it
However, this increases barrier to entry because you are asking users to generate their own content
This makes the contest much harder to participate in
Email gated contests: In this case, you ask people to provide their email addresses to participate in the contest
This makes this an excellent option for building a mailing list
All of these strategies help you to create a representative Instagram profile that adds value to your brand when mentioned, which drives more brand engagement and recall, and which provokes positive reaction to your brand
You should want your photographs to receive several comments and likes, and there are several data measuring tools to measure the depth of engagement you Instagram profile receives
There are several other techniques that you can use to build your profile up
#Use text overlays on your images As mentioned earlier, Instagram is a picture heavy site
The space for text is usually reserved for purposes of captioning, and in general text is not often seen
This does not mean that text has no place in Instagram
Try to use text overlays on the images to communicate whatever message you wish to do
These should be brief, descriptive, and indicative of the kind of brand you’re representing
Communicate any information you want to pass across to your audience through text overlays
You can use any major photo editing software to achieve this
#Have clear calls to action in your captions Your captions are the closest thing to the conventional advertising space on Instagram
Captions are hardly read, in comparison to the images itself; try not change that
At all costs, do not be vague on what you want your audience to do
Your captions should include a clear, simple, and direct call to action
Ensure that you are very descriptive of what you want the audience to do
You can have such calls to actions such as “like it to lower the price”; in this case, you should set milestones of how many likes you should get to lower the price by a certain percentage
You can use others like “click on the link in the bio section”
The focus is on simplicity and ease; you need not be extremely creative with your captions
#Unleash the power of hashtags Your captions or comments should have relevant hashtags to help you increase your reach, overall visibility and engagement
You can use hashtags that are related to your business, your target audience, your posts and anything else
Hashtags work slightly differently in Instagram unlike in Twitter
For starters, the lack of a character limit means that you can use as many hashtags as you would like
Unlike in Facebook, where too many hashtags is frowned upon, the fact that relatively few people pay attention to the captions of the images in Instagram means that you may use as many hashtags as you like
Thus, don’t be afraid to use many hashtags (as many as 30 hashtags or more)
Try to incorporate a mixture of popular, unique (custom hashtags) and less popular hashtags
However, do not use a hashtag for the sake of using a hashtag
Work with the above combinations to come up with 510 hashtags, which seems to be the best range for Instagram
#Use other social media platforms All social media platforms involves crosspromotion
This is a strategically useful tactic, because every social media platform provides something different that you can incorporate into your overall social media strategy
Instagram, for starters, is owned by Facebook, which means that it can directly be incorporated into your Facebook page, however a simple widget can also provide a stream for a website or blog, and Instagram can easily connect with Twitter as well
You can use Instagram with other social media platforms to take full advantage of all the benefits of the individual platforms
You can cross promote your social media accounts just to increase your audience in each platform
However, the benefits of cross promotion extend far beyond introducing new audiences to the brand: it can give rise to several creative opportunities as well
Just remember that owing to the differences between the platforms, they should not be exactiy the same
If they are, you are probably using one platform too many  you should consider merging both of these platforms into one, and the one which is suggested is the one which has greater engagement returns for you
#Be unique Since Instagram is essentially a photofeed, your competition in gaining the attention of your followers is all the other photographs in the platform
As usual, the trick is to not view these as competition at all
Have a clear idea of what you wish to do with your Instagram profile, and then work at it by highlighting your individual talent
Your uniqueness or creativity in your photo creation will ultimately determine whether your photo stands out or not
You can showcase your talent in cooking, dancing and doing lots of other things
DIY how to videos can also do some magic in impressing your audience and generating a larger audience
You should also ensure that you bring out your personality excellendy such that your audience can clearly tell between your content and other people’s content
Unique, zany, and brilliant content that is posted regularly are the perfect ingredients for you to build up a community around your Instagram account, which should be your overall aim with the platform
You shouldn’t forget to post consistendy though; this helps you to build trust in the audience
#Analyze This is true for all social media in general, but Instagram in particular can provide a rich amount of data that you can analyze
Analytic tools that help you in this regard include Ico no square and Totems 
You can come to an understanding of the kind of content that your target audience likes: Instagram’s hashtag feature gives you a constant grip on the trending topics, which you can cross measure with other social media platforms to build an idea about how impactful trends in Instagram are in other platforms
You should also have your benchmarks like the number of likes, comments and shares based on the number of your followers
Additionally, you should try posting at different times to know when you get the most engagement
The purpose of data collection and analysis is to build a comprehensive picture of how your social media plan is doing, and what you need to change and build on to make it work better for the demands of the brand
TIPS ON HOW TO DOMINATE PINTEREST Today, there is an added focus on visual marketing
The era of long copy newspaper ads has passed, being replaced instead by ads with low amounts of text and a focus on the image
If visual marketing is the current trend coupled with the fact that a picture can tell 1000 words, all you need is Pinterest to tell your stories
As you have noticed throughout the book, I have been emphasizing on the importance of using pictures, videos and other visual stuff to captivate your audience
How does Pinterest work? Pinterest basically acts as a way to pin interesting articles from all around the internet
These can be grouped under several sections so that they can be accessed easily and without any hassle
People with shared interests can pin stories from other people’s Pinterest boards, giving the website a sense of community
In a very short time, Pinterest has become a vibrant and thriving social network that is especially prized by marketing experts
Actually, research shows that Pinterest brings in more buyers than any other social media site, ahead of Facebook, Twitter and Google+
Pinterest is one of the fastest growing social networks that bring high levels of engagement, increased audience response, and a very high clickthrough rate
Success in Pinterest is imperative for a number of social media projects, especially those that have a lot to do with images
So, how do you succeed on Pinterest? Here are some tips to guide you towards success: #Ensure all your posts have a captivating photo Essentially, Pinterest works to collect information from various sources
It does not work like a content creating site but as a content sharing site
However, as a content sharing site it has many features that can lead to it becoming your social network of choice
A pin on a Pinterest board is represented by the image that is attached along with the web page
You will likely be pinning your own blog posts and content on Pinterest, so make sure that each of your posts has an elegant, contextual photograph
Pinterest is highly visual, as is its audience, and having a photograph is absolutely necessary
If you have older posts that have no photos, start adding photos to them and then pin them
#Create a business account Pinterest has many features that are tailored for businesses
This is part of the reason why it is one of the most exciting social networks around today
Thus, when creating an account, make sure that you create a business account, so that you can benefit from the various features and perks of the social network
Doing so also gives your brand a face that people can associate with
If you already have some followers on a personal account, change it to a business account
As you do this, ensure that you use a profile image that people can recognize easily; it could be a logo or a product that you want to be known for
#Partner with influential guest pinners Look out for popular Pinterest bloggers who have boards that relate to your brand, and invite them to partner with you in creation and curation of content
This works as a symbiotic relationship with you gaining access to the guest’s audience and following and the guest having access to concessions and first glimpses at your product
The keywords for this activity are hence increased sales and following, ultimately leading to brand awareness and recall
#Engage creatively with your audience You could show your appreciation for your audience by baking a cake for them and pinning the photo on your board
You could also find a way of ensuring that you inspire your audience based on the kind of pins you have
You could also use this to help people generate new ideas on various aspects of their life
This should help you in getting more pins, followers and repins
You need to be useful for your followers, while also being relevant to the kind of brand your represent and the kind of voice and identity your brand wishes to pursue
However, there is no dearth of creative ways in which you can engage with those who follow you
Ultimately, you are looking to build a community around your pin, and thus around the brand, which is vibrant, selfperpetuating and supportive
#Ensure that your bio and board are descriptive Your bio and board represent the kind of brand you are and the kind of information that you wish to be thought of in association with
Keep your bio simple, clean, and direct
Similarly, categorize your pins so that anyone can navigate your page with ease
Moreover, ensure that you don’t have too many boards that could end up having irrelevant photos
Give some thought to your categories
The solution may not always be to create a new category, but when you do so, think of the future and other posts as well
Does your postfit better in another category? All this helps in making your Pinterest board an organized, informative, and fun experience for your audience
#Be a regular pinner We have already talked about the short span of attention that posts receive in social media
A post lasts in popular consciousness for less than half an hour
In this context, it is important that you post regularly
The benefits of posting regularly cannot be diminished
This can be a great way of attracting a huge following by engaging them actively since very many of your competitors might probably not be pinning regularly
This means that you can easily attract a fairly good following by just pinning as often as once a week
With regular pinning, you will be creating a competitive edge
Posting regularly not only helps build followers for the short term, but keeps you comprehensively in the trending topics of the day and age, and helps you stay relevant, fresh and creative
#DoiTt just pin photos While popular consciousness often frames Pinterest as a board devoted to pictures, it is much more flexible
You can pin videos from YouTube and Vimeo as well, which means that Pinterest is an exciting avenue for cross promotion, providing support to video channels and to major photo blogging websites as well
As a place to curate content, you should build up a vast and varied amount of content about all sorts of subjects while staying pertinent to your core interest
Specifically in this case, however, Pinterest can provide you with a huge boost to your video view count
#Follow more people on Pinterest Pinterest provides a host of exciting engagement opportunities
You can find people who share interests with you in a very simple manner (that is, indeed, the point of the network) and then you can follow them to view the kind of websites and articles they are pinning
You can thus get an idea about the kind of content you should post
If you like any of the contents they share, make sure to engage them with that  share or repin their pins and leave a comment if you have an insight
Engage your followers regularly and thank those who share or repin your pins, especially if they do so with original content
Yet again, a sense of competition is not characteristic of Pinterest  try to work with people with shared interests rather than against them
This will help you create a community around yours and other related boards
The more you do that, the more you will have an army of people who will be constantiy pinning, sharing, and following your content
#Have a board where you pin your products and product ideas Keep all of your products under a single board (though you can add secondary pins to them depending on the products)
Also, ensure that you have a Pin it button on your website, blog posts, and other places
This should make it easy for your followers to pin and follow you, and your products
If your brand has a substantial presence on Pinterest, you can also add a simple widget that can display the best of your Pinterest board
#Be human Social media places most of its emphasis on human interactions between the brand and the audience
It is by virtue of personal attention placed by the brand towards its customers that the brand awareness, recall and identity is built
You need to show this human aspect of your brand through the cumulative sum of your activities on Pinterest
Share your goals, desires, dreams, preferences, aspirations, and style
In a bid to do that, you could have a board about whatever happens behind the curtains (who is behind the business, how do you do stuff etc)
People like knowing stuff about others
Loyal customers can appreciate a personal angle about your brand
TIPS ON HOW TO DOMINATE OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS The tips mentioned above are related to the most popular social networks today
Together, Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest account for much of the social networking that is done in the world
However, remember that they are not alone
The world of social media is still in an experimental stage
Newer and more intriguing concepts are continually being formed which compete or work well in a cross platform with the above media
The following are general tips and strategies for some of these platforms
The platforms I am going to discuss here, in brief, are Tumblr, Snapchat, and Flickr
All three are very different from one another
Flickr is an image and video hosting platform that provides native functionality to be embedded in any website
It has its own community, and focuses on high quality photographs, but its largest traffic comes from hosting photographs, images, and videos in blogs and websites
Flickr had a reported membership of 87 million in 2013, while hosting over 6 billion images, a number that continues to steadily grow
More than 4 million images are uploaded daily
Flickr works in a fairly simple manner
Every image uploaded goes into a sequential Flickr “photo stream”, which can be accessed by all
The photographs are viewable in all kinds of modes, including portrait and landscape, justified and as a slideshow
These photographs can be tagged, with Flickr being one of the first websites to implement the tag cloud feature that is commonplace nowadays
The community functions around these tags, Flickr Groups, and by “Following” the photo streams of other Flickr photographers
Flickr also provides photo editing and filtering options for its users
As one of the fastest growing image sharing and hosting websites on the web, Flickr may be the perfect fit for your social media strategy
While using Flickr directly for advertising purposes is against its terms of conditions, it is a valuable way to build engagement for your website or your blog and earn indirect marketing exposure from the medium
Here are some tips to do so: #Use your profile to advertise your brand You can add the name of your company, your website, and a description about yourself in its profile
Your profile will be one of your most visited links on your Flickr photo streams, and thus a well written, creative, and descriptive entry here can be an excellent way to increase publicity for your brand
Remember to keep it informal, and not like a sales pitch
Another thing you can do is make the company logo as your profile picture
#UpIoad quality pictures relating to your products This is where you can know whether Flickr is useful for your brand or not
Can your workplace and your brand easily translate to the medium of photography? If so, Flickr is definitely for you
For example, if you’re in the hotel industry, you can take pictures of the view from your hotel, some of the meals, and other things that have directly to do with your company
Another example is that of a woodworker, who can show pictures of the wood, some of their designs, their workplace, their studio, and other such images
Don’t just show off your products, but be creative and artistic
Do not sell your photographs, but share the best photographs with your audience
#Avoid the hard sell You can add text as captions to your photographs
Unlike Instagram and other image sharing websites discussed above, text on Flickr is not consigned to the bottom of the page
Be as creative as you like with the text provided, but remember to be brief and descriptive
However, avoid the hard sell by all means
Not only is directly trying to sell your products on Flickr against the terms and conditions, it is also considered bad form
Flickr is just not the space for that kind of marketing
The focus should be on the photograph, not on the sales pitch
The caption should not even be the sales pitch
The photographs will sell your brand for you
#Share your photos in the appropriate groups Flickr groups cover a variety of subjects
Your brand will definitely be covered in some of them
Find appropriate groups and post your pictures there
For example, if you’re running a scented candle shop, you will find groups to share pictures of some of them
Also remember to share your pictures in local groups, like that of the locality, the city, or the state
When appropriate, posting pictures in such groups will allow you to reach the perfect audience  those who are local to your company or business, and who are interested in precisely the things that your company offers
#Link your photo stream everywhere Your website, blog and other sites should leave a prominent display to your Flickr photo stream, if you have one
The reasons for this are more than one
Firstly, your audience would appreciate having access to your Flickr stream
Secondly, some of your audience will also be on Flickr and may follow you (remember to return the favor if they do!), and thirdly and most importantly, people clicking on your photo stream from your website will drive the page ranking of your website and your Flickr stream higher, making it more likely for them to appear higher in search results relating to your tag
#Participate in the community The Flickr community is vibrant, informed, and helpful
Join in with the community  like and comment on photographs that are interesting, provide any insight if you have any and participate in the activities brought up by the groups
All these will incrementally raise the profile of your brand and company
To conclude, Flickr is admittedly not very useful if you’re representing an insurance company, or a bank
However if your brand has strong visual elements that can translate into great photographs and photostories, Flickr can be an excellent app to both share and promote great content and an exciting, innovative brand image
Snapchat is a video/photo messaging application that was first released in 2011
Snapchat works on the basis of sending 'snaps’, photographs or videos which can be viewed by everyone a friend list or by selected people, which disappear a few seconds after they are opened
Users of Snapchat were sharing more than 700 million photos and videos last year, and it is a growing platform that has taken the fancy of a young generation of users who can take photographs of moments and send them to their friends
However, from a personal photosharing app built primarily for teenagers, Snapchat has evolved into a very interesting marketing tool
As noted before, Snapchat allows a photo to be seen for a maximum of just a few seconds long, after which the photo disappears forever
This means that you as a marketer need to make the most of the ten or so seconds you have to deliver an exciting, catchy, and irresistible product
Here’s what you need to know: #Understand your audience Even if your target is a group of executives, you need to grasp a critical idea about the kind of environment Snapchat has developed
It has always been an app that encourages casual conversation in the form of photographs and videos amongst its users
The kinds of activities that are documented are not professional in nature, but are those of informal situations such as dinner, or a picnic
In fact, the overall casual nature of the app is critical for a wellconstructed marketing strategy
The language you need to use should be easy to understand and comprehend
Your posts should have a sense of fun; for example, try experimenting with the draw feature that Snapchat provides
You can take snaps at your workplace with the usual shenanigans  as long as it is not contrived it will only give your brand added humanity in the eyes of prospective customers
#Play with the time limit Just like Twitter, the time limit of Snapchat may seem daunting, but it is an exciting limitation that you can creatively incorporate into your marketing strategy
Snapchat is an ideal opportunity to provide your followers with teasers to new products, teasers and other changes
They also work very well with certain themes in mind, such as festivals, parties, and others
You can build up to the launch of a major product with several small teasers on Snapchat  and the necessary deletion of the data afterwards will mean that the community will create a sense of anticipation around your product by itself
#Contests The time limit can also lead to you making innovative contests where you can encourage your followers to share a picture with your product with their followers
The idea is to constantiy engage with your followers, not as a brand or a company but as a person, and to encourage the generation of user generated content that can be provided by your followers
# Videos Just like the images, the videos on Snapchat disappear once seen
Videos offer you a chance to verbalize your message, and to retain a sense of exclusivity around it, seeing as people who have missed your message shall not be able to see it again
In this age when almost anything can be found on the internet for free anyway, a sense of exclusivity around your products never hurt
You can take videos of company lunches, crazy moments at work and other such videos  your followers will appreciate these
Further, you do not require a professional  remember: Snapchat works in a casual and informal atmosphere, and a shaky camera will work better as long as the moment seems (and is) genuine
#Show your personality Social media is the great enabler that lends some personality, vivacity, and verve to a brand
It helps build a voice that the customers and target audiences of the brand can relate to in a tangible manner
And Snapchat has the potential of being the most capable to bring out this human side of your brand, bar none
Try to bring some variety into your snaps by asking various people at the company to contribute, and try to express that unique spirit that best represents your brand  the contribution it can have to your company’s success is just immense
The value of humanizing brands in the age of social media is limitiess, but doing well at Snapchat can be incredibly helpful to build a community of interest audiences, and get your brand and company to trend
With approximately 30 million users in the US alone, Snapchat provides an incredible opportunity for your brand to connect with a lot of people in your target audience
To use it effectively is to understand the audience and the environment that informs the app  casual, informal, and genuine will always trump something that looks like it has been carefully and deliberately done
Tumblr is a microblogging website that was launched in 2007
Tumblr, like WordPress or Blogger, provides a platform for a bloglike interface, however the site promotes an instant sharing, and photoheavy stream of content, similar to Twitter
Tumblr is especially popular with the teenage and young adult demographics, with half of Tumblr’s visitors being under the age of 25
Tumblr hosts over 250 million blogs and more than 100 billion posts in total
The numbers are clear; Tumblr is the largest hosted platform on the web, with WordPress lagging far behind with about 70 million users
However, the most unique and catching aspect of Tumblr is its demographic
While teenagers have been leaving conventional social media like Facebook, Tumblr still retains one of the largest online presences curated and made by teenagers on the web today
This means that it is more than just a niche group that can be looked at for the purpose of marketing
Tumblr works by providing the functionality of a blog and the services commonly found in a social network, such as likes, hashtags, sharing, and following
Simply put, it’s a blog with incredible viral potential owing to its built in social media functions
Further, it is incredibly visual, borrowing a page from Pinterest’s books in terms of how it handles images  placing them all in one blog page instead of multiple boards
Here’s what you can do to take advantage of one of the fastest growing social media platforms out there
#Post Images Over 75% of all posts on Tumblr contain images  with good reason
It is remarkably friendly to images, and they look great in the Tumblr feed
As mentioned before, for marketing purposes an image nearly always works better than text, and the medium of a microblog is even more conducive to increased engagement via the popular reblog function
The reblog function allows you to post content posted by another blog, and links the content from their site, giving both blogs added views
This is a very popular function, with many “tumblrogs” choosing just to reblog content all the time
#Focus on a Niche The sheer number of diverse audiences means that Tumblr can quickly become overwhelming for the marketer
For this reason, focus on a very tight and specific niche group that is appropriate for your brand
This will also lend your brand an identity and voice, something which is really necessary for the often chaotic website
#Link to your main website Tumblr provides almost endless customization options of your homepage, and while a great look is necessary, and provides an excellent understanding of your brand to your visitor, it is very important to provide a link to your main site  so that followers can access your content off Tumblr as well
#Link every image to your blog Images made by you can and will go viral at any time
This is the reason you always want your images to link back to your own post
Link every image to your blog, and no matter when and where the image goes viral, your blog will receive the hits, and the users will always find their way back to your site
#Join the Community Tumblr has a growing, expanding, and enthusiastic community around it
That is why you are encouraged to look around and find blogs which blog the same content you do, and follow them
Most blogs follow back, and you can find great blogs to engage with by just looking around the kind of content being posted by blogs you follow
Further, join in with the community and participate  the profile of your brand will invariably improve
#Add social share buttons Tumblr supports the addition of a widget that can help content on your tumblrog be seen on other media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and your website
Cross platforming can only help your audience to find out more about you  as usual, remember to focus on providing distinct and useful content in every blog, each blog should have a distinct purpose of its own
#Connect Instagram Instagram is one of the media platforms that are similar to Tumblr, in that a majority of the community on both platforms is members of both platforms
Simply connect your Instagram profile to your Tumblrog, and you will have double the exposure on both feeds for a little effort
Remember that Instagram essentially provides cross promotion functionality, and Tumblr can be a viable means to support this feature
#Use Hashtags Tumblr’s usage of hashtags is distinct from both Twitter and Instagram, in that hashtags are seriously used by content creators to advertise their content
Using hashtags judiciously, but in the casual spirit of Tumblr that encourages informal catchphrases can allow you to use hashtags for added exposure and visibility
Try getting your brand name in the hashtag, though it is not as likely to succeed as in Twitter, or in Instagram, because of the very casual community around Tumblr
#Be responsive Social media provides an important opportunity for you to direcdy interact with your customers
Use this opportunity well  focus on providing quick and useful response to commenters about all kinds of insight  this well help increase brand recall and recognition and further allow your brand opportunities to engage with your audience and be seen in a good light
#Engage with other posts The incredible number of content on Tumblr means that there will always be something pertinent to do with your brand on your dashboard
Leave a comment or a response to something  most tumblroggers will definitely appreciate it  and participating in the community allows your blog’s exposure and visibility to rise
# Videos Videos are also provided native functionality on Tumblr
Keep your videos short  videos that are shorter receive up to 40% more engagement than longer videos
Noncelebrities on videos receive much more engagement than videos with celebrities in them  the site is full of videos about celebrities, advertisements work better with a real touch
To conclude, Tumblr is the 28 th largest site on the Internet, and receives the highest revenue per click after Facebook in the entire Internet
As such, Tumblr still has a restricted demographic with youths and teenagers dominating
However, with great functionality that combines the best of three sites to provide a unique experience, Tumblr is almost certain to become one of the most important websites from the point of view of marketing
Its stickiness and high clickthrough rate already make it an immensely important tool for the purpose of marketing  giving you a highly versatile platform that can be used for a variety of purposes
Perhaps the only limitation to Tumblr as of now is that there is no real mobile functionality so far  once that is found, Tumblr is set to be one of the largest and most important websites on the internet
And it is much better to ride that wave if you already have a brand presence in Tumblr at that time
Several big money brands have joined in on the Tumblr bandwagon, such as Adidas, Coca Cola, and eBay, Disney, GQ, Gucci, NBA, and BMW
All these brands are trying to preemptively arrive on the platform, and on the basis of the rising evidence, what is clear is that everyone else must, too
You are almost certain to find value in a tumblrog
DON’T MAKE THESE MISTAKES IF YOU WANT TO DOMINATE SOCIAL MEDIA Social Media is a landscape of exciting opportunities for the purpose of marketing
A steady stream of content generation with very little monetary input may seem like a perfecdy good deal, but it is also imperative that you be conscious of certain important things
Etiquette is a very important facet of judging a brand  your voice may be informal or formal, based on witty repartee or not, however, you must never break the simple rules of etiquette that the Internet works around
The Internet can have a really long memory when it comes to something negative  since nothing can truly be deleted from the Internet
If you make a monumental mistake, be warned, someone will remember that mistake every time you try to do anything on social media
Though a mistake here is not the end of the world, do not consciously break any of the following rules: #Do not spam Spam is one of the single most annoying things that is commonly encountered on the Internet
Spam is the incessant providing of links and websites that offer no constructive benefit to the visitor
In fact, it is often seen that clicking on one of the spam links downloads malware or a virus to the computer
Spamming is usually perpetrated by online robots, but do not post too much at once, and do not post information that is useless to anybody
This is just annoying, and is a major turnoff
It can also be incredibly damaging to the reputation of your brand
Spamming is considered one of the biggest breaches of etiquette online
#Keep your mind open Do not reject a form of expression out of hand
Different social media platforms are better for different kinds of media
Try creating content in different topics, and choose the best medium for your content based on what your audience prefers not on any other criteria
In general, a healthy social media presence recommends a mix of both images and video and sparse but constant usage of text
Most importantly, be well informed about the content you post and make sure it is sourced, and documented
If your data then turns out to be wrong, you may graciously apologize, but you should not post without the bare minimum of having done your research
Use multimedia and other features to add value for your audience
#Do not ignore the data One of the chief virtues of marketing on social media is the wealth of data collecting options that you can use to measure the impact of your social media strategy
Overlooking the important of analytics can be a huge mistake
Today, the importance of statistics on social media is far beyond justifying a campaign or two  it can provide an insight into the brand and its products
This is the chief difference as compared to conventional media, where it is not as easy to measure engagement or impact  however with social media it is much easier to measure both and to compare with the increase in the performance of the brand over the same period
Ignore the statistics at your own peril  but the well thought out social media plan takes the data seriously, and attempts to make use of it in a constructive manner
For this reason, do not measure data for the purpose of measuring data
Measure data for an explicit purpose
For example, if you want to measure the increased engagement with the brand over the time of a particular campaign, you will want to look at the specific reach of posts after the campaign has been launched
If you do not know why you’re measuring the data, you will never know what data to measure in the first place
You simply cannot know how well you are doing unless you measure your performance
As a rule of thumb, the numbers never lie; your gut feeling could be very wrong
#A11 platforms are not the same This is one of the most common sins done even by major brands
The problem is that most brands realize that having a presence in different social media platforms is advantageous
They then proceed to post the same content on different platforms
This is a dangerous assumption
Different platforms are different
Different kinds of posts work better on different platforms owing to a host of reasons
One of them is the environment around which the social network is built
Another is the target audience that can be found in the different social networks
A major reason is simply that, like you, several members of your audience are on different platforms as well, and seeing the same content everywhere makes your brand look lazy, uncaring, and uninterested in the platform
For a kind of marketing that most requires a brand to be genuine, human, and responsive, this kind of judgment can be incredibly harmful
Treat every platform you are on with respect
Understand them and the audiences you will be exposed to in each of them
Do not just push content and ideas to them
Understand what your audience in each platform wants and then develop a strategy for providing what they want; not for what you are selling
#Do not focus too much on yourself Since social media provides you the opportunity to, it is tempting to always tell audiences more about your brand, the way it works, and the services that it offers
But this is counterintuitive
Social media does not work on this basis at all
By all means, talk about the values of your brand, but posts such as these, known as proprietary posts, should be few and far between
The focus should not be on your product and your services, but on the problems of your audience, and how your products help them in that direction
If you talk merely about your products or your brand, your audience is going to have a tough time relating to what you’re trying to say
In this regard, it is probably worthwhile to note that a variety of posts is the best option for social media
Provide different kinds of information in different ways to best contribute to your audience’s lives with your posts
One of the most important kind of posts in this regard is user generated content
If you do not have any available, try hosting a contest, which encourages the submission of usergenerated content, and then post them
In time, you may have a steady stream of usergenerated content, which will reduce your workload, and place the attention back to where it belongs: your audience
Another way of posting content is curating content from around the web  bringing important information to the knowledge of your audience
As long as this information is relevant to your brand, this is an excellent way of helping your audience while reminding them that your brand can be a help while dealing with the problems mentioned in the posts that you have shared
Go for variety and flexibility  they work much better with the chaos of social media than a rigid schedule
#Promote your content Just posting your content on a social media platform is not enough
Nearly every social media platform provides way to promote the content you post
For example, on Facebook you can highlight a post for a nominal fee to make it appear on newsfeeds of targeted audiences
On Twitter, Instagram, Blogs, and Tumblr, tags and hashtags can help audiences find your content even if they are not direcdy following your blog
Give a clear call to action that will tell audiences what do with your content  this may be as simple as “like and share this image” to more complicated call to actions
The idea is to acknowledge that different social media platforms work differendy  and are particularly suited for certain kinds of content
You need to know what platform is the best for the kind of content you’re posting, not just in the terms of target audience or the environment of the platform, but also in terms of how you can effectively promote your content after creating it
Know your social networks, and analyze the kind of content, format, and posts that your audiences in each social media platform prefer
But also keep an eye out on ways to improve the engagement of posts on specific social networks
Whilst doing this, also step up the production of content that is almost universally applicable
One kind of content that falls into this category is quotes, which is appreciated in all formats and in all social media platforms
Another way of guaranteeing that your content is well received is by partnering with influential users of the respective social network
This will increase engagement with your posts, create a buzz around your content, and provide for brand recall and awareness
#Maintain Etiquette Be aware of the basic etiquette when conversing with another person
Do not use complicated words, and do not by any means make a grammatical or spelling error
If you do so, correct yourself promptly and apologize for your error
Do not aggressively type in larger case (except in informal scenarios when it is accepted to do so) and be polite, erudite and professional with your audiences
Reply promptly to any feedback you receive, and thank the commenter for the feedback, whether negative or positive
The rule of thumb is to treat other people the way they would treat you, and this is no different when you’re representing a brand
Courtesy and informative behavior is always remembered and appreciated by audiences
Strive to be helpful, and if you do not have access to the information that the customer needs, make sure to keep them informed about the way their feedback is being handled every step of the way  this will give a positive image to your brand as one receptive to communication and feedback and as one that respects and considers the advice of its customers
CONCLUSION Thank you again for downloading this book! I hope this book has helped you learn about some effective strategies and techniques you can use to create a strong social media brand presence
A strong social media presence is predicated, as I hope you have understood, on a decidedly human, personal, and unique touch
Thus by definition the hints and tips suggested in this book are useful only as a guideline for the kind of content, strategies and tactics you will use
In social media, there is no formula, but the great aspect of the medium is that it allows you the room to explore and experiment with different kinds of content to find out what format of posts, and what kinds of information is best suited for your brand, and for you target audience
Considering that a large part of our social media presence involves some kind of marketing or another, it is also important to note that this is just the beginning
As we have discussed while talking about the history of social media, social media received a huge splash because it broadened the avenues for people with common interests from around the world to interact with each other
It then became an industry, and marketing has entered this industry to find the audiences that have been weaned away from conventional forms such as television and newspapers towards the Internet
However, the current generation has been raised almost exclusively on the Internet, and is very savvy with social media
Technology, too, has been advancing to fulfill this need
It is interesting to note that a majority of the world actually does not have access to the Internet, whilst in the developed world plans to experiment with Virtual Reality have already seen the light of the day
In any case, whatever the future of social media itself is, marketing on social media has just seen the beginning,  it is an industry that needs much finetuning and work
Thankfully, the ample amount of room to experiment and develop the perfect working strategies is a boon that guarantees success in the field
On that note, the role of the competitor has changed as well
Earlier, the promotions between rival brands would be intense, but with the advent of public social media, every brand is brought to an equal level
Now, a global brand such as Nike might have to compete against local shoe brands as well, if they have a well thought out media plan
Access to more money means better chances of good advertising, but social media has been the great leveler in that even brands with comparatively low funds have been able to find success online  social media prizes creative nous and plain luck much more than conventional media, meaning that it is much more unpredictable
Nevertheless, always ensure that you check out what your competitors are doing on their social media accounts; you could get a lot of insight on how to mold your business for the best
Competition on social media networks thus works in a slighdy different manner
This difference is especially pronounced on platforms that see a lot of curating instead of content generation by themselves, such as Pinterest
Here, the competition is not for the better pins, because everyone has access to the blogs to pin, but the competition is towards generating a community around a board
Thus the conventional arenas of competitions have changed and have been replaced by new, virtual ones
And as a last note, it is important to note that statistically speaking, organically grown social media presences boast far better brand recall and engagement statistics than a media strategy that focuses on engagement over content
Engagement is a very important metric for social media, but good content, irrespective of how it is presented and how many opportunities it has to engage with the audience, always wins
Do not worry so much about engagement as you should about content  the network guarantees engagement by itself, but good content is what will let you stand out, stick out of the crowd, and capture the attention, love, and loyalty of your audiences
Thus it may seem like your methods are not working, but keep going at it, and try to capture the attention of your audience with your content
While how to best engage your audience is an important skill, it can be learned with some ease,  good content comes from practice
